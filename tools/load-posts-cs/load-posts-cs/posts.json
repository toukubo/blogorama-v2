When a user happens to crash out of a web session however (as can happen for instance when lightning strikes the user's computer and does not give her a chance to cleanly exit the browser and shut the computer down) that little notification does not ever reach the ISAPI extension and the web server remains tragically unaware of the user's untimely end. After twiddling thumbs for some time though the ISAPI extension runs out of patience and just ends that user's session.

If you try the following XAML in the excellent [Kaxaml](http://www.kaxaml.com/) tool for instance:\n\n    <Window xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n            xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n            Width=\"300\"\n            Height=\"300\"\n            Title=\"Centered?\">\n      <Grid>  \n        <Canvas Background=\"Black\" Width=\"300\" Height=\"300\">\n          <Ellipse Width=\"50\"\n                   Height=\"50\"\n                   Canvas.Left=\"125\"\n                   Canvas.Top=\"125\"\n                   Fill=\"LightGray\"\n                   x:Name=\"ellipse\" />\n        </Canvas>\n      </Grid>\n    </Window>\n\nHere's what you see:\n\n![Off center](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/center1.png)\n\nClearly the ellipse is not positioned in the center of the containing canvas even though the point `(125,125)` should in fact have done so. If however you set the value `None` for the `WindowStyle` attribute of the `Window` tag like so (note the code in bold):\n\n    <Window xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n            xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n            Width=\"300\"\n            Height=\"300\"\n            Title=\"Centered?\"\n            WindowStyle=\"None\">\n      <Grid>  \n        <Canvas Background=\"Black\" Width=\"300\" Height=\"300\">\n          <Ellipse Width=\"50\"\n                   Height=\"50\"\n                   Canvas.Left=\"125\"\n                   Canvas.Top=\"125\"\n                   Fill=\"LightGray\"\n                   x:Name=\"ellipse\" />\n        </Canvas>\n      </Grid>\n    </Window>\n\nThen here's what you get (you'll have to hit `Alt+F4` to close this window):\n\n![Centered but no title bar](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/center2.png)\n\nAs you can probably tell, the circle seems nicely centered now. The problem therefore is the title bar. In the first XAML code snippet above I had given a dimension of `300x300` for the canvas. Accounting for the height of the title bar, this causes the canvas to actually extend beyond the window border which of course, gets clipped by the OS. In order to trim the canvas to size I decided to put it inside a dock panel and remove the explicit width/height specification. Here's what I came up with:\n\n    <Window xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n            xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n            Width=\"300\"\n            Height=\"300\"\n            Title=\"Centered?\">\n      <DockPanel>  \n        <Canvas Background=\"Black\">\n          <Ellipse Width=\"50\"\n                   Height=\"50\"\n                   Canvas.Left=\"125\"\n                   Canvas.Top=\"125\"\n                   Fill=\"LightGray\"\n                   x:Name=\"ellipse\" />\n        </Canvas>\n      </DockPanel>\n    </Window>\n\nThis produced a window that looked like this:\n\n![Again off center](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/center3.png)\n\nAgain, not quite in the center of the client area. The issue here is of course that now, the canvas size is not `300x300` which means the point `(125,125)` should not be the top left co-ordinate of the ellipse if we want it centered. Here's a little XAML that shows you the real dimensions of the canvas.\n\n    <Window xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n            xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n            Width=\"300\"\n            Height=\"300\"\n            Title=\"Centered?\">\n      <DockPanel>  \n        <Canvas Background=\"Black\" x:Name=\"canvas\">\n          <Ellipse Width=\"50\"\n                   Height=\"50\"\n                   Canvas.Left=\"125\"\n                   Canvas.Top=\"125\"\n                   Fill=\"LightGray\"\n                   x:Name=\"ellipse\" />\n          <TextBlock Text=\"{Binding ElementName=canvas, Path=ActualWidth}\"\n                     Canvas.Left=\"10\"\n                     Canvas.Top=\"10\"\n                     Foreground=\"White\"/>\n          <TextBlock Text=\", \"\n                     Canvas.Left=\"30\"\n                     Canvas.Top=\"10\"\n                     Foreground=\"White\"/>\n          <TextBlock Text=\"{Binding ElementName=canvas, Path=ActualHeight}\"\n                     Canvas.Left=\"38\"\n                     Canvas.Top=\"10\"\n                     Foreground=\"White\"/>\n        </Canvas>\n      </DockPanel>\n    </Window>\n\nHere's what the window that this produces looks like:\n\n![Actual dimensions of the canvas](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/center4.png)\n\nThe correct top-left co-ordinate to center the ellipse therefore is `(121,108)`. The straightforwad solution seems to be to just handle it in code and be done with it. For example, the following code in the window class's constructor manages to do the job:\n\n    this.Loaded += (sender, e) =>\n    {\n        Canvas.SetLeft(ellipse, (canvas.ActualWidth - ellipse.ActualWidth) / 2);\n        Canvas.SetTop(ellipse, (canvas.ActualHeight - ellipse.ActualHeight) / 2);\n    };\n\nBut this isn't quite the WPF way of doing things and besides if you resized the window the ellipse would again be off center and you'd need to write more code to handle the window resize events and re-layout the ellipse in response. Ideally, these sort of things should be handled using the WPF binding system. At first I figured this should be really easy to do with XAML like this:\n\n    <Window xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n            xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n            Width=\"300\"\n            Height=\"300\"\n            Title=\"Centered?\">\n      <DockPanel>  \n        <Canvas Background=\"Black\" x:Name=\"canvas\">\n          <Ellipse Width=\"50\"\n                   Height=\"50\"\n                   Canvas.Left=\"{Binding ElementName=canvas, Path=((ActualWidth - 50)/2)}\"\n                   Canvas.Top=\"{Binding ElementName=canvas, Path=((ActualHeight - 50)/2)}\"\n                   Fill=\"LightGray\"\n                   x:Name=\"ellipse\" />\n        </Canvas>\n      </DockPanel>\n    </Window>\n\nHere's what this produced:\n\n![Passing expressions to binding path does not work](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/center5.png)\n\nAs it turns out one cannot use expressions for the value of the `Path` attribute of the `Binding` markup extension! Some folks over at [blendables.com](http://www.blendables.com/) have however solved this problem by developing a custom WPF markup extension that allows the specification of expressions. You can get it [here](http://www.blendables.com/files/folders/essentials_documentation/entry148.aspx). But this seemed a bit extreme given the circumstances. The alternative as it happens is to use multi-binding with a custom value converter. First we write a class that implements `IMultiValueConverter` like so:\n\n    public class HalfValueConverter : IMultiValueConverter\n    {\n        #region IMultiValueConverter Members\n\n        public object Convert(object[] values,\n                              Type targetType,\n                              object parameter,\n                              CultureInfo culture)\n        {\n            if (values == null || values.Length < 2)\n            {\n                throw new ArgumentException(\n                    \"HalfValueConverter expects 2 double values to be passed\" +\n                    \" in this order -> totalWidth, width\",\n                    \"values\");\n            }\n\n            double totalWidth = (double)values[0];\n            double width = (double)values[1];\n            return (object)((totalWidth - width) / 2);\n        }\n\n        public object[] ConvertBack(object value,\n                                    Type[] targetTypes,\n                                    object parameter,\n                                    CultureInfo culture)\n        {\n            throw new NotImplementedException();\n        }\n\n        #endregion\n    }\n\nAnd then we use the following XAML (you cannot do this in Kaxaml because it does not support writing code-behind) to get the job done!\n\n    <Window x:Class=\"CenterWin.Window1\"\n            xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n            xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n            Title=\"Centered?\"\n            Height=\"300\"\n            Width=\"300\"\n            Background=\"Black\"\n            xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:CenterWin\">\n        <DockPanel>\n            <DockPanel.Resources>\n                <local:HalfValueConverter x:Key=\"HalfValue\" />\n            </DockPanel.Resources>\n            <Canvas x:Name=\"canvas\">\n                <Ellipse Width=\"50\"\n                         Height=\"50\"\n                         Fill=\"LightGray\"\n                         x:Name=\"ellipse\">\n                    <Canvas.Left>\n                        <MultiBinding Converter=\"{StaticResource HalfValue}\">\n                            <Binding ElementName=\"canvas\" Path=\"ActualWidth\" />\n                            <Binding ElementName=\"ellipse\" Path=\"ActualWidth\" />\n                        </MultiBinding>\n                    </Canvas.Left>\n                    <Canvas.Top>\n                        <MultiBinding Converter=\"{StaticResource HalfValue}\">\n                            <Binding ElementName=\"canvas\" Path=\"ActualHeight\" />\n                            <Binding ElementName=\"ellipse\" Path=\"ActualHeight\" />\n                        </MultiBinding>\n                    </Canvas.Top>\n                </Ellipse>\n            </Canvas>\n        </DockPanel>\n    </Window>\n\nThat's it! Now you can resize to your heart's content and the WPF binding system will take care of all the updates. Here's a screenshot of the window after resizing it a bit.\n\n![Nicely centered!](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/center6.png)","html":"<p>While I was fiddling around with WPF in general I noticed that when I dropped inane little circles and boxes onto a canvas I'd never be able to center it inside the containing canvas just right. If you try the following XAML in the excellent <a href=\"http://www.kaxaml.com/\">Kaxaml</a> tool for instance:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Window xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        Width=\"300\"\n        Height=\"300\"\n        Title=\"Centered?\"&gt;\n  &lt;Grid&gt;  \n    &lt;Canvas Background=\"Black\" Width=\"300\" Height=\"300\"&gt;\n      &lt;Ellipse Width=\"50\"\n               Height=\"50\"\n               Canvas.Left=\"125\"\n               Canvas.Top=\"125\"\n               Fill=\"LightGray\"\n               x:Name=\"ellipse\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/Canvas&gt;\n  &lt;/Grid&gt;\n&lt;/Window&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's what you see:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/center1.png\" alt=\"Off center\" /></p>\n\n<p>Clearly the ellipse is not positioned in the center of the containing canvas even though the point <code>(125,125)</code> should in fact have done so. If however you set the value <code>None</code> for the <code>WindowStyle</code> attribute of the <code>Window</code> tag like so (note the code in bold):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Window xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        Width=\"300\"\n        Height=\"300\"\n        Title=\"Centered?\"\n        WindowStyle=\"None\"&gt;\n  &lt;Grid&gt;  \n    &lt;Canvas Background=\"Black\" Width=\"300\" Height=\"300\"&gt;\n      &lt;Ellipse Width=\"50\"\n               Height=\"50\"\n               Canvas.Left=\"125\"\n               Canvas.Top=\"125\"\n               Fill=\"LightGray\"\n               x:Name=\"ellipse\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/Canvas&gt;\n  &lt;/Grid&gt;\n&lt;/Window&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then here's what you get (you'll have to hit <code>Alt+F4</code> to close this window):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/center2.png\" alt=\"Centered but no title bar\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can probably tell, the circle seems nicely centered now. The problem therefore is the title bar. In the first XAML code snippet above I had given a dimension of <code>300x300</code> for the canvas. Accounting for the height of the title bar, this causes the canvas to actually extend beyond the window border which of course, gets clipped by the OS. In order to trim the canvas to size I decided to put it inside a dock panel and remove the explicit width/height specification. Here's what I came up with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Window xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        Width=\"300\"\n        Height=\"300\"\n        Title=\"Centered?\"&gt;\n  &lt;DockPanel&gt;  \n    &lt;Canvas Background=\"Black\"&gt;\n      &lt;Ellipse Width=\"50\"\n               Height=\"50\"\n               Canvas.Left=\"125\"\n               Canvas.Top=\"125\"\n               Fill=\"LightGray\"\n               x:Name=\"ellipse\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/Canvas&gt;\n  &lt;/DockPanel&gt;\n&lt;/Window&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This produced a window that looked like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/center3.png\" alt=\"Again off center\" /></p>\n\n<p>Again, not quite in the center of the client area. The issue here is of course that now, the canvas size is not <code>300x300</code> which means the point <code>(125,125)</code> should not be the top left co-ordinate of the ellipse if we want it centered. Here's a little XAML that shows you the real dimensions of the canvas.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Window xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        Width=\"300\"\n        Height=\"300\"\n        Title=\"Centered?\"&gt;\n  &lt;DockPanel&gt;  \n    &lt;Canvas Background=\"Black\" x:Name=\"canvas\"&gt;\n      &lt;Ellipse Width=\"50\"\n               Height=\"50\"\n               Canvas.Left=\"125\"\n               Canvas.Top=\"125\"\n               Fill=\"LightGray\"\n               x:Name=\"ellipse\" /&gt;\n      &lt;TextBlock Text=\"{Binding ElementName=canvas, Path=ActualWidth}\"\n                 Canvas.Left=\"10\"\n                 Canvas.Top=\"10\"\n                 Foreground=\"White\"/&gt;\n      &lt;TextBlock Text=\", \"\n                 Canvas.Left=\"30\"\n                 Canvas.Top=\"10\"\n                 Foreground=\"White\"/&gt;\n      &lt;TextBlock Text=\"{Binding ElementName=canvas, Path=ActualHeight}\"\n                 Canvas.Left=\"38\"\n                 Canvas.Top=\"10\"\n                 Foreground=\"White\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/Canvas&gt;\n  &lt;/DockPanel&gt;\n&lt;/Window&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's what the window that this produces looks like:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/center4.png\" alt=\"Actual dimensions of the canvas\" /></p>\n\n<p>The correct top-left co-ordinate to center the ellipse therefore is <code>(121,108)</code>. The straightforwad solution seems to be to just handle it in code and be done with it. For example, the following code in the window class's constructor manages to do the job:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.Loaded += (sender, e) =&gt;\n{\n    Canvas.SetLeft(ellipse, (canvas.ActualWidth - ellipse.ActualWidth) / 2);\n    Canvas.SetTop(ellipse, (canvas.ActualHeight - ellipse.ActualHeight) / 2);\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this isn't quite the WPF way of doing things and besides if you resized the window the ellipse would again be off center and you'd need to write more code to handle the window resize events and re-layout the ellipse in response. Ideally, these sort of things should be handled using the WPF binding system. At first I figured this should be really easy to do with XAML like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Window xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        Width=\"300\"\n        Height=\"300\"\n        Title=\"Centered?\"&gt;\n  &lt;DockPanel&gt;  \n    &lt;Canvas Background=\"Black\" x:Name=\"canvas\"&gt;\n      &lt;Ellipse Width=\"50\"\n               Height=\"50\"\n               Canvas.Left=\"{Binding ElementName=canvas, Path=((ActualWidth - 50)/2)}\"\n               Canvas.Top=\"{Binding ElementName=canvas, Path=((ActualHeight - 50)/2)}\"\n               Fill=\"LightGray\"\n               x:Name=\"ellipse\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/Canvas&gt;\n  &lt;/DockPanel&gt;\n&lt;/Window&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's what this produced:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/center5.png\" alt=\"Passing expressions to binding path does not work\" /></p>\n\n<p>As it turns out one cannot use expressions for the value of the <code>Path</code> attribute of the <code>Binding</code> markup extension! Some folks over at <a href=\"http://www.blendables.com/\">blendables.com</a> have however solved this problem by developing a custom WPF markup extension that allows the specification of expressions. You can get it <a href=\"http://www.blendables.com/files/folders/essentials_documentation/entry148.aspx\">here</a>. But this seemed a bit extreme given the circumstances. The alternative as it happens is to use multi-binding with a custom value converter. First we write a class that implements <code>IMultiValueConverter</code> like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class HalfValueConverter : IMultiValueConverter\n{\n    #region IMultiValueConverter Members\n\n    public object Convert(object[] values,\n                          Type targetType,\n                          object parameter,\n                          CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        if (values == null || values.Length &lt; 2)\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException(\n                \"HalfValueConverter expects 2 double values to be passed\" +\n                \" in this order -&gt; totalWidth, width\",\n                \"values\");\n        }\n\n        double totalWidth = (double)values[0];\n        double width = (double)values[1];\n        return (object)((totalWidth - width) / 2);\n    }\n\n    public object[] ConvertBack(object value,\n                                Type[] targetTypes,\n                                object parameter,\n                                CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n\n    #endregion\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then we use the following XAML (you cannot do this in Kaxaml because it does not support writing code-behind) to get the job done!</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Window x:Class=\"CenterWin.Window1\"\n        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        Title=\"Centered?\"\n        Height=\"300\"\n        Width=\"300\"\n        Background=\"Black\"\n        xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:CenterWin\"&gt;\n    &lt;DockPanel&gt;\n        &lt;DockPanel.Resources&gt;\n            &lt;local:HalfValueConverter x:Key=\"HalfValue\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/DockPanel.Resources&gt;\n        &lt;Canvas x:Name=\"canvas\"&gt;\n            &lt;Ellipse Width=\"50\"\n                     Height=\"50\"\n                     Fill=\"LightGray\"\n                     x:Name=\"ellipse\"&gt;\n                &lt;Canvas.Left&gt;\n                    &lt;MultiBinding Converter=\"{StaticResource HalfValue}\"&gt;\n                        &lt;Binding ElementName=\"canvas\" Path=\"ActualWidth\" /&gt;\n                        &lt;Binding ElementName=\"ellipse\" Path=\"ActualWidth\" /&gt;\n                    &lt;/MultiBinding&gt;\n                &lt;/Canvas.Left&gt;\n                &lt;Canvas.Top&gt;\n                    &lt;MultiBinding Converter=\"{StaticResource HalfValue}\"&gt;\n                        &lt;Binding ElementName=\"canvas\" Path=\"ActualHeight\" /&gt;\n                        &lt;Binding ElementName=\"ellipse\" Path=\"ActualHeight\" /&gt;\n                    &lt;/MultiBinding&gt;\n                &lt;/Canvas.Top&gt;\n            &lt;/Ellipse&gt;\n        &lt;/Canvas&gt;\n    &lt;/DockPanel&gt;\n&lt;/Window&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That's it!

He talks about the plugin over [here](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/). I figured it'd be fun to produce my own (possibly naive) implementations of the idea just for kicks and generally talk about it here (you might want to use Ben Alman's implementation for production code though - this article simply talks about one possible implementation of the idea). First, what exactly do we mean by *throttling* and *debouncing*?\r\n\r\n### Throttling\r\n\r\nImagine a scenario where you have an event handler written for some event that tends to get raised a bit too often. Handlers for the mouse move and the window scroll events are good examples. Imagine that you need to do something heavyweight from these handlers - like making an [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) call. In this case, you probably do not really need to make that big expensive AJAX call **every single time** the event is fired. Things would probably work just as fine if the function was called, say, no more than 3 times a second. Here's where function throttling helps. The idea is to basically build a thin wrapper function that can moderate calls to your actual routine by providing an intercepting routine that rations invocations based on call frequency. Here's one way how you might implement the throttling routine:\r\n\r\n    //\r\n    // Throttle calls to \"callback\" routine and ensure that it\r\n    // is not invoked any more often than \"delay\" milliseconds.\r\n    //\r\n    function throttle(delay, callback) {\r\n        var previousCall = new Date().getTime();\r\n        return function() {\r\n            var time = new Date().getTime();\r\n\r\n            //\r\n            // if \"delay\" milliseconds have expired since\r\n            // the previous call then propagate this call to\r\n            // \"callback\"\r\n            //\r\n            if ((time - previousCall) >= delay) {\r\n                previousCall = time;\r\n                callback.apply(null, arguments);\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd here's how you might choose to use the function from a web page to register a handler for the window's scroll event and make sure that it is not invoked more than once every 300 milliseconds.\r\n\r\n    window.onscroll = throttle(300, function() {\r\n        //\r\n        // Big expensive AJAX call here\r\n        //\r\n    });\r\n\r\nOr if you are a jQuery kind of person then you might do it this way:\r\n\r\n    $(window).scroll(throttle(300, function() {\r\n        //\r\n        // Big expensive AJAX call here\r\n        //\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nNow one thing that you might have noted about this implementation is that it is a bit lossy - in that the data that is passed to the event handler tends to go wherever it is that ignored data like to go whenever the wrapper routine decides to not propagate the call to the actual routine. In this case the scroll position information is lost. In most cases, this is of no significance and you're probably quite happy knowing the current scroll position when the throttled call does take place. But if you happen to have some weird requirement where no piece of data can be lost and would like the data from the intermediary calls to be accumulated and passed to the callback, well, then, here's another version of throttle that does exactly that. This implementation simply accumulates all the data and makes it available to the target routine via a property called \"data\" in the \"this\" object of the final callback routine.\r\n\r\n    //\r\n    // Throttle calls to \"callback\" routine and ensure that it\r\n    // is not invoked any more often than \"delay\" milliseconds.\r\n    // Accumulates all data passed to the callback routine during\r\n    // calls that are not passed on to \"callback\" and then hands\r\n    // it off to \"callback\" via a property called \"data\" on the\r\n    // context object for that call.  \"data\" is a (possibly jagged)\r\n    // 2 dimensional array containing the data accumulated during\r\n    // all the calls to the throttled function since the previous\r\n    // expiration of \"delay\" milliseconds.\r\n    //\r\n    function throttle(delay, callback, accumulateData) {\r\n        var previousCall = null;\r\n        var theData = [];\r\n        return function () {\r\n            var time = new Date().getTime();\r\n\r\n            //\r\n            // accumulate arguments in case caller is interested\r\n            // in that data\r\n            //\r\n            if (accumulateData) {\r\n                var arr = [];\r\n                for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; ++i)\r\n                    arr.push(arguments[i]);\r\n                theData.push(arr);\r\n            }\r\n            if (!previousCall ||\r\n                (time - previousCall) >= delay) {\r\n                previousCall = time;\r\n                callback.apply((accumulateData) ? { data: theData} : null, arguments);\r\n                theData = []; // clear the data array\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn case you happen to be that one other person on the internet who I hear has an interest in Common Lisp *and* JavaScript at the same time, then maybe you'd appreciate a Common Lisp version of the throttling routine (the version that ignores data passed to the routine during intermediary calls that are not propagated to the actual callback).\r\n\r\n    ;;\r\n    ;; throttles invocations to routine identified by \"callback\"\r\n    ;; so that it is invoked no more frequently than \"delay\" interval;\r\n    ;; \"delay\" is interpreted as being a measure of \"internal-time-units-per-second\"\r\n    ;; units;\r\n    ;;\r\n    (defun throttle (delay callback)\r\n        (let ((previousCall nil))\r\n            #'(lambda (&rest p)\r\n                (if (or (not previousCall)\r\n                        (>= (- (get-internal-real-time) previousCall) delay))\r\n                    (progn\r\n                        (setf previousCall (get-internal-real-time))\r\n                        (apply callback p))))))\r\n\r\n### Debouncing\r\n\r\nDebouncing is also a technique for managing the frequency of calls that a routine receives. The difference between *debouncing* and call *throttling* might seem a bit subtle at first, but it really isn't. While *throttling* is about simply restricting the frequency of calls that a function receives to a fixed time interval, i.e. ensuring that the target function is not invoked more often than the specified delay, *debouncing* is about coalescing multiple calls that happen on a given routine so that repeated calls that occur before the expiration of a specific time duration are ignored. OK, that sounds confusing to me and I just wrote it. Let's take a sample scenario.\r\n\r\nImagine that you're writing some kind of online collaboration app and you want to provide a multi-user whiteboard feature of some sort that'll let multiple participants doodle on the whiteboard simultaneously for some reason. Now, a couple of approaches immediately spring to mind:\r\n\r\n-   Capture mouse co-ordinates as the lines are being drawn and broadcast them to all the participants. This approach provides instant feedback of the doodling process as it takes place but results in an exponential number of network packets being transmitted between participants and could also result in overloading the server with requests. Clearly, this is not going to scale.\r\n-   Wait for complete line segments to be drawn before transmitting the path co-ordinates to everybody. Admittedly, this approach is a pretty decent one and something that users are quite likely to find as being an acceptable compromise. Having said that however, I think we can do better! The doodling process usually involves little breaks as lines are being drawn - I might draw a path and then pause a bit before deciding where to head off next. Wouldn't it be great if we could leverage those \"pauses\" to quickly dispatch the co-ordinates to everybody? That's exactly what *debouncing* allows you to do.\r\n\r\nDebouncing is the process of translating multiple calls to a function that occur during a given time period to a single call (so far this is exactly the same as call *throttling*) with the added caveat that the receipt of a new call to the function before the expiration of the specified delay results in a resetting of the time to wait before a call to the actual routine can be propagated next. For instance, if the established delay is 250ms, then every call to the debounced routine before the expiration of 250ms results in a fresh wait being initiated for another 250ms. Once 250ms expire, a single call is made to the actual routine. Here's a sample implementation:\r\n\r\n    //\r\n    // Debounce calls to \"callback\" routine so that multiple calls\r\n    // made to the event handler before the expiration of \"delay\" are\r\n    // coalesced into a single call to \"callback\". Also causes the\r\n    // wait period to be reset upon receipt of a call to the\r\n    // debounced routine.\r\n    //\r\n    function debounce(delay, callback) {\r\n        var timeout = null;\r\n        return function () {\r\n            //\r\n            // if a timeout has been registered before then\r\n            // cancel it so that we can setup a fresh timeout\r\n            //\r\n            if (timeout) {\r\n                clearTimeout(timeout);\r\n            }\r\n            var args = arguments;\r\n            timeout = setTimeout(function () {\r\n                callback.apply(null, args);\r\n                timeout = null;\r\n            }, delay);\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou might use this routine like so to debounce the mouse move event handler:\r\n\r\n    window.mousemove = debounce(250, function() {\r\n        //\r\n        // Big expensive AJAX call here\r\n        //\r\n    });\r\n\r\nAs before, this should work just as well if you're into jQuery:\r\n\r\n    $(window).mousemove(debounce(250, function(event) {\r\n        //\r\n        // Big expensive AJAX call here\r\n        //\r\n    }));\r\n\r\nJust as with throttling, the implementation given above results in the data that was passed to the event handler during calls that end up getting ignored being lost. In case you need access to all the data when the call is finally propagated to the target routine, then you might want to go with the following version of debounce:\r\n\r\n    //\r\n    // Debounce calls to \"callback\" routine so that multiple calls\r\n    // made to the event handler before the expiration of \"delay\" are\r\n    // coalesced into a single call to \"callback\".

Pretty neat in my opinion!\r\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http://benalman.com/\">Ben Alman</a> has written up a useful little <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> plugin for addressing situations where a JavaScript function in your web page is getting called a tad too frequently and you want to reduce the frequency to more manageable levels. He talks about the plugin over <a href=\"http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/\">here</a>. I figured it'd be fun to produce my own (possibly naive) implementations of the idea just for kicks and generally talk about it here (you might want to use Ben Alman's implementation for production code though - this article simply talks about one possible implementation of the idea). First, what exactly do we mean by <em>throttling</em> and <em>debouncing</em>?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"throttling\">Throttling</h3>\n\n<p>Imagine a scenario where you have an event handler written for some event that tends to get raised a bit too often. Handlers for the mouse move and the window scroll events are good examples. Imagine that you need to do something heavyweight from these handlers - like making an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)\">AJAX</a> call. In this case, you probably do not really need to make that big expensive AJAX call <strong>every single time</strong> the event is fired. Things would probably work just as fine if the function was called, say, no more than 3 times a second. Here's where function throttling helps. The idea is to basically build a thin wrapper function that can moderate calls to your actual routine by providing an intercepting routine that rations invocations based on call frequency. Here's one way how you might implement the throttling routine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//\n// Throttle calls to \"callback\" routine and ensure that it\n// is not invoked any more often than \"delay\" milliseconds.\n//\nfunction throttle(delay, callback) {\n    var previousCall = new Date().getTime();\n    return function() {\n        var time = new Date().getTime();\n\n        //\n        // if \"delay\" milliseconds have expired since\n        // the previous call then propagate this call to\n        // \"callback\"\n        //\n        if ((time - previousCall) &gt;= delay) {\n            previousCall = time;\n            callback.apply(null, arguments);\n        }\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here's how you might choose to use the function from a web page to register a handler for the window's scroll event and make sure that it is not invoked more than once every 300 milliseconds.</p>\n\n<pre><code>window.onscroll = throttle(300, function() {\n    //\n    // Big expensive AJAX call here\n    //\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or if you are a jQuery kind of person then you might do it this way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(window).scroll(throttle(300, function() {\n    //\n    // Big expensive AJAX call here\n    //\n}));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now one thing that you might have noted about this implementation is that it is a bit lossy - in that the data that is passed to the event handler tends to go wherever it is that ignored data like to go whenever the wrapper routine decides to not propagate the call to the actual routine. In this case the scroll position information is lost. In most cases, this is of no significance and you're probably quite happy knowing the current scroll position when the throttled call does take place. But if you happen to have some weird requirement where no piece of data can be lost and would like the data from the intermediary calls to be accumulated and passed to the callback, well, then, here's another version of throttle that does exactly that.

Upon encountering a new `SCRIPT` node, the browser immediately starts loading the code and evaluating it (and also freezes pretty much everything else in the browser while it is doing this!). If we can have the external resource render a call to a function that we define (or to a well-known function name) in the script that it produces then we can effectively have a callback routine invoked when the data is received from the foreign domain. The function to be called when the script dynamically loads is usually passed in as a query string parameter in the `GET` request or can be a function name that is mandated by the 3rd party site. Flickr for example defaults to rendering a call to a function called `jsonFlickrApi` but allows you to override this by passing a different name via the `jsoncallback` query string parameter.\n\n**jQuery** has direct support for JSONP in that if you include a `callback=?` parameter in the AJAX URL for the [`getJSON`](http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.getJSON#urldatacallback) call then it will replace the `?` with a dynamically generated global JavaScript function name that it also defines. The word `callback` can be replaced with anything else as we did above by using `jsoncallback`. All the grunt work of dynamically adding `SCRIPT` tags to the DOM is done by jQuery.\n\nNow, imagine that you designed your own little REST based service using ASP.NET MVC and have opted to provide JSON as one of the data output formats and wish to support JSONP requests. This basically means that you simply need to wrap your JSON output in a call to a user-supplied or a standard JavaScript function. So instead of rendering something like this out to the client:\n\n    {\n        photos : [\n            photo : {\n                id : 232992,\n                secret : \"bAC980980c09c08a0ef\"\n            }\n        ],\n        page : 1,\n        total : 500,\n        photosPerPage : 10\n    }\n\nYou want to render something like this:\n\n    callback({\n        photos : [\n            photo : {\n                id : 232992,\n                secret : \"bAC980980c09c08a0ef\"\n            }\n        ],\n        page : 1,\n        total : 500,\n        photosPerPage : 10\n    });\n\nWhere `callback` is the name of the JavaScript function defined by the client that needs to be invoked when the script is evaluated by the browser. If you wanted your ASP.NET MVC controllers to support this, how would you do it? The first approach I took was to simply define a custom [`ActionResult`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.actionresult.aspx) class that would produce the correct script. Here's what this looks like:\n\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Renders result as JSON and also wraps the JSON in a call\n    /// to the callback function specified in \"JsonpResult.Callback\".\n    /// </summary>\n    public class JsonpResult : JsonResult\n    {\n        /// <summary>\n        /// Gets or sets the javascript callback function that is\n        /// to be invoked in the resulting script output.\n        /// </summary>\n        /// <value>The callback function name.</value>\n        public string Callback { get; set; }\n\n        /// <summary>\n        /// Enables processing of the result of an action method by a\n        /// custom type that inherits from\n        /// <see cref=\"T:System.Web.Mvc.ActionResult\"/>.\n        /// </summary>\n        /// <param name=\"context\">The context within which the\n        /// result is executed.</param>\n        public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context)\n        {\n            if (context == null)\n                throw new ArgumentNullException(\"context\");\n\n            HttpResponseBase response = context.HttpContext.Response;\n            if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(ContentType))\n                response.ContentType = ContentType;\n            else\n                response.ContentType = \"application/javascript\";\n\n            if (ContentEncoding != null)\n                response.ContentEncoding = ContentEncoding;\n\n            if (Callback == null || Callback.Length == 0)\n            {\n                Callback = context.HttpContext.\n                  Request.QueryString[\"callback\"];\n            }\n\n            if (Data != null)\n            {\n                // The JavaScriptSerializer type was marked as obsolete\n                // prior to .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 \n    #pragma warning disable 0618\n                JavaScriptSerializer serializer = \n                     new JavaScriptSerializer();\n                string ser = serializer.Serialize(Data);\n                response.Write(Callback + \"(\" + ser + \");\");\n    #pragma warning restore 0618\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nNow you can simply return a `JsonpResult` (note the p before the \"R\" in \"Result\") from your action methods instead of `JsonResult` and everything should just work. Client's would indicate that this is a JSONP request by appending a query string parameter called `callback` to the request with the name of a JavaScript function that is to be called. I wasn't however, entirely happy with this situation as this would mean that I'd have to go and change the return type of *all* my action methods to return a `JsonpResult` instead of a `JsonResult`. And also update the code that instantiated `JsonResult`. I wanted a less disruptive solution if you will.\n\nIt is precisely for scenarios such as this that the ASP.NET MVC framework includes extension points in the form of [action filters](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd410209.aspx). Action filters are basically hooks that you can define to intercept and enhance request processing in various ways. ASP.NET MVC allows you to define filters that get called *before* and/or *after* the action method is invoked and also *before* and/or *after* the `ExecuteResult` method on the `ActionResult` is invoked. Action filters are defined as .NET custom attribute classes that inherit from [ActionFilterAttribute](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.actionfilterattribute.aspx). `ActionFilterAttribute` defines 4 virtual methods that you can override to hook into the request processing pipeline at the right juncture. The `OnActionExecuted` method for instance is invoked immediately *after* the action method has been invoked and gives you a chance to further process the returned result. This would perfectly suit our purpose here where we wish to conditionally supplant the `JsonResult` object being returned from the action method with a `JsonpResult` instead. Here's what I came up with:\n\n    public class JsonpFilterAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute\n    {\n        public override void OnActionExecuted(\n                ActionExecutedContext filterContext)\n        {\n            if(filterContext == null)\n                throw new ArgumentNullException(\"filterContext\");\n\n            //\n            // see if this request included a \"callback\" querystring\n            // parameter\n            //\n            string callback = filterContext.HttpContext.\n                      Request.QueryString[\"callback\"];\n            if (callback != null && callback.Length > 0)\n            {\n                //\n                // ensure that the result is a \"JsonResult\"\n                //\n                JsonResult result = filterContext.Result as JsonResult;\n                if (result == null)\n                {\n                    throw new InvalidOperationException(\n                        \"JsonpFilterAttribute must be applied only \" +\n                        \"on controllers and actions that return a \" +\n                        \"JsonResult object.\");\n                }\n\n                filterContext.Result = new JsonpResult\n                {\n                    ContentEncoding = result.ContentEncoding,\n                    ContentType = result.ContentType,\n                    Data = result.Data,\n                    Callback = callback\n                };\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nAs is perhaps self-evident, we simply check if the query string included a parameter called `callback` and if it did, then we supplant the `Result` object in `filterContext` with a new `JsonpResult` instance. This approach allows us to enable JSONP processing on a controller or an action method by simply tagging on the `JsonpFilter` attribute. If I wanted all of my methods in the controller to support JSONP then, I can do this:\n\n    [JsonpFilter]\n    public class DoofusController : Controller\n    {\n        //\n        // all your action methods here\n        //\n    }\n\nOr if I wanted it to work with only a specific action method then I'd do this:\n\n    public class DoofusController : Controller\n    {\n        [JsonpFilter]\n        public JsonResult DoTheThing(string data, string moreData)\n        {\n            return new JsonResult\n            {\n                Data = FetchSomeData(data, moreData)\n            };\n        }\n    }\n\nASP.NET MVC is kind of cool eh?! :-P","html":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json#JSONP\">JSONP</a> is the technique of making cross-domain HTTP requests via JavaScript circumventing browser security restictions on requests that return data in the JSON format. By cross-domain, we refer to the practice of making HTTP requests on URLs that refer to resources residing on a domain other than the one from where the page being viewed/executed was loaded from. You'll find a good description of what JSONP is all about <a href=\"http://www.developria.com/2009/03/what-in-the-heck-is-jsonp-and.html\">here</a>. Briefly, the technique exploits a browser back-door where the <code>SRC</code> attribute on a <code>SCRIPT</code> tag is allowed to be a \"foreign\" URL and the browser will download the code and evaluate it. But then again, this is perhaps not so much a <em>back-door</em> as a <em>feature</em> that allows you to build mash-ups by composing code that draws on functionality hosted on different servers.

Upon encountering a new <code>SCRIPT</code> node, the browser immediately starts loading the code and evaluating it (and also freezes pretty much everything else in the browser while it is doing this!). If we can have the external resource render a call to a function that we define (or to a well-known function name) in the script that it produces then we can effectively have a callback routine invoked when the data is received from the foreign domain. The function to be called when the script dynamically loads is usually passed in as a query string parameter in the <code>GET</code> request or can be a function name that is mandated by the 3rd party site. Flickr for example defaults to rendering a call to a function called <code>jsonFlickrApi</code> but allows you to override this by passing a different name via the <code>jsoncallback</code> query string parameter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>jQuery</strong> has direct support for JSONP in that if you include a <code>callback=?</code> parameter in the AJAX URL for the <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.getJSON#urldatacallback\"><code>getJSON</code></a> call then it will replace the <code>?</code> with a dynamically generated global JavaScript function name that it also defines. The word <code>callback</code> can be replaced with anything else as we did above by using <code>jsoncallback</code>. All the grunt work of dynamically adding <code>SCRIPT</code> tags to the DOM is done by jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>Now, imagine that you designed your own little REST based service using ASP.NET MVC and have opted to provide JSON as one of the data output formats and wish to support JSONP requests. This basically means that you simply need to wrap your JSON output in a call to a user-supplied or a standard JavaScript function. So instead of rendering something like this out to the client:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    photos : [\n        photo : {\n            id : 232992,\n            secret : \"bAC980980c09c08a0ef\"\n        }\n    ],\n    page : 1,\n    total : 500,\n    photosPerPage : 10\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You want to render something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>callback({\n    photos : [\n        photo : {\n            id : 232992,\n            secret : \"bAC980980c09c08a0ef\"\n        }\n    ],\n    page : 1,\n    total : 500,\n    photosPerPage : 10\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where <code>callback</code> is the name of the JavaScript function defined by the client that needs to be invoked when the script is evaluated by the browser. If you wanted your ASP.NET MVC controllers to support this, how would you do it? The first approach I took was to simply define a custom <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.actionresult.aspx\"><code>ActionResult</code></a> class that would produce the correct script. Here's what this looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;\n/// Renders result as JSON and also wraps the JSON in a call\n/// to the callback function specified in \"JsonpResult.Callback\".\n/// &lt;/summary&gt;\npublic class JsonpResult : JsonResult\n{\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// Gets or sets the javascript callback function that is\n    /// to be invoked in the resulting script output.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    /// &lt;value&gt;The callback function name.&lt;/value&gt;\n    public string Callback { get; set; }\n\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// Enables processing of the result of an action method by a\n    /// custom type that inherits from\n    /// &lt;see cref=\"T:System.Web.Mvc.ActionResult\"/&gt;.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    /// &lt;param name=\"context\"&gt;The context within which the\n    /// result is executed.&lt;/param&gt;\n    public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context)\n    {\n        if (context == null)\n            throw new ArgumentNullException(\"context\");\n\n        HttpResponseBase response = context.HttpContext.Response;\n        if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(ContentType))\n            response.ContentType = ContentType;\n        else\n            response.ContentType = \"application/javascript\";\n\n        if (ContentEncoding != null)\n            response.ContentEncoding = ContentEncoding;\n\n        if (Callback == null || Callback.Length == 0)\n        {\n            Callback = context.HttpContext.\n              Request.QueryString[\"callback\"];\n        }\n\n        if (Data != null)\n        {\n            // The JavaScriptSerializer type was marked as obsolete\n            // prior to .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 \n#pragma warning disable 0618\n            JavaScriptSerializer serializer = \n                 new JavaScriptSerializer();\n            string ser = serializer.Serialize(Data);\n            response.Write(Callback + \"(\" + ser + \");\");\n#pragma warning restore 0618\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you can simply return a <code>JsonpResult</code> (note the p before the \"R\" in \"Result\") from your action methods instead of <code>JsonResult</code> and everything should just work. Client's would indicate that this is a JSONP request by appending a query string parameter called <code>callback</code> to the request with the name of a JavaScript function that is to be called. I wasn't however, entirely happy with this situation as this would mean that I'd have to go and change the return type of <em>all</em> my action methods to return a <code>JsonpResult</code> instead of a <code>JsonResult</code>. And also update the code that instantiated <code>JsonResult</code>. I wanted a less disruptive solution if you will.</p>\n\n<p>It is precisely for scenarios such as this that the ASP.NET MVC framework includes extension points in the form of <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd410209.aspx\">action filters</a>. Action filters are basically hooks that you can define to intercept and enhance request processing in various ways. ASP.NET MVC allows you to define filters that get called <em>before</em> and/or <em>after</em> the action method is invoked and also <em>before</em> and/or <em>after</em> the <code>ExecuteResult</code> method on the <code>ActionResult</code> is invoked. Action filters are defined as .NET custom attribute classes that inherit from <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.actionfilterattribute.aspx\">ActionFilterAttribute</a>. <code>ActionFilterAttribute</code> defines 4 virtual methods that you can override to hook into the request processing pipeline at the right juncture. The <code>OnActionExecuted</code> method for instance is invoked immediately <em>after</em> the action method has been invoked and gives you a chance to further process the returned result. This would perfectly suit our purpose here where we wish to conditionally supplant the <code>JsonResult</code> object being returned from the action method with a <code>JsonpResult</code> instead. Here's what I came up with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class JsonpFilterAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute\n{\n    public override void OnActionExecuted(\n            ActionExecutedContext filterContext)\n    {\n        if(filterContext == null)\n            throw new ArgumentNullException(\"filterContext\");\n\n        //\n        // see if this request included a \"callback\" querystring\n        // parameter\n        //\n        string callback = filterContext.HttpContext.\n                  Request.QueryString[\"callback\"];\n        if (callback != null &amp;&amp; callback.Length &gt; 0)\n        {\n            //\n            // ensure that the result is a \"JsonResult\"\n            //\n            JsonResult result = filterContext.Result as JsonResult;\n            if (result == null)\n            {\n                throw new InvalidOperationException(\n                    \"JsonpFilterAttribute must be applied only \" +\n                    \"on controllers and actions that return a \" +\n                    \"JsonResult object.\");\n            }\n\n            filterContext.Result = new JsonpResult\n            {\n                ContentEncoding = result.ContentEncoding,\n                ContentType = result.ContentType,\n                Data = result.Data,\n                Callback = callback\n            };\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As is perhaps self-evident, we simply check if the query string included a parameter called <code>callback</code> and if it did, then we supplant the <code>Result</code> object in <code>filterContext</code> with a new <code>JsonpResult</code> instance. This approach allows us to enable JSONP processing on a controller or an action method by simply tagging on the <code>JsonpFilter</code> attribute. If I wanted all of my methods in the controller to support JSONP then, I can do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[JsonpFilter]\npublic class DoofusController : Controller\n{\n    //\n    // all your action methods here\n    //\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or if I wanted it to work with only a specific action method then I'd do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DoofusController : Controller\n{\n    [JsonpFilter]\n    public JsonResult DoTheThing(string data, string moreData)\n    {\n        return new JsonResult\n        {\n            Data = FetchSomeData(data, moreData)\n        };\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>ASP.NET MVC is kind of cool eh?! :-P</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1255941909290,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1398532599190,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1255941909290,"published_by":1},{"id":8,"uuid":"3ca252e7-4328-457c-83a7-b5d76953f0df","title":"Web Camps / Zeollar - Demos and decks","slug":"webcampszeollardemosanddecks","markdown":"If you attended any of the one day [Web Camps](http://www.microsoft.com/india/events/webcamps/) events that Microsoft has been conducting across various cities in India then you probably saw me talk about one or both of the following:\r\n\r\n-   Sizzlers on the Web - WebSockets & IndexedDB\r\n-   Programming with HTML5 & Related Technologies\r\n\r\nAnd you might have heard me proclaim that I shall put the demos and the decks up for download on my blog \"soon\".

If you're wondering what exactly ECMAScript is and why you should be interested, it turns out that ECMAScript is *standardese*for a language that the rest of the world knows as JavaScript. Strictly speaking (no pun on title intended) JavaScript and ECMAScript aren't identical. JavaScript is a dialect of ECMAScript but the differences are mostly negligible and are largely there for historical backward compatibility reasons. ECMAScript 5 (henceforth referred to as ES5) brings a suite of interesting features to the table, many of which have as their goal, the introduction of greater programming discipline to the language.\r\n\r\nIn this post (and over the next few posts), we review one such feature which directly addresses some of the [more notorious parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) of the language. This new feature is known as \"strict mode\", which briefly, is a whole new execution mode for JavaScript that causes the execution engine to run code with slightly different semantics.\r\n\r\n### What is strict mode?\r\n\r\n\"Strict mode\" is a way of causing the runtime engine to interpret and execute JavaScript with different semantics than what one sees with unrestricted code. Code running in strict mode has the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n1.  Excludes some syntactic and semantic features, i.e., you can't do some things that you are allowed to do otherwise\r\n2.  Modifies semantics of some features, i.e., same code runs differently in strict mode compared to what happens in unrestricted mode\r\n3.  An expanded list of scenarios that cause errors to be raised instead of them being silently ignored or running with assumed intent\r\n4.  Applies to specific code units - i.e., you cannot have strict mode apply to all your .js files at one shot (unless you concatenate all of them of course, in which case its one code unit as far as the runtime is concerned)\r\n\r\nThe basic rationale behind strict mode is the introduction of some runtime enforced discipline to JavaScript development. I have always felt that JavaScript is far too dynamic for its own good and in my opinion, strict mode tries to address some of that excessive dynamism. Many of the tricky parts of the language that required programmer discipline are now enforced by the engine when you mark a particular code segment as \"strict\". Can you spot the bug in the following snippet? With \"strict mode\" turned on, the runtime will!\r\n\r\n    function findProduct(numbers) {\r\n        var product = 0,\r\n            len = numbers.length;\r\n        for(var i = 0; i < len; ++i) {\r\n            prodct = product * numbers[i];\r\n        }\r\n        return product;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n### Browser support\r\n\r\nPretty much all modern browsers support strict mode in their respective JavaScript engines. On Internet Explorer (IE) strict mode is available from version 10 onwards. You can download the latest platform preview of IE10 from the [IE test drive site](http://bit.ly/npkR2M). All the samples in this article have been tested on IE10 platform preview 2 (IE10 PP2) using a JavaScript [eval console](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-JavaScriptevalconsole.aspx) I had put together sometime back. Selected samples have been tested on *Google Chrome 14* and *Firefox 7 beta* as well.\r\n\r\n### Strict mode contexts\r\n\r\nRunning a piece of JavaScript under strict mode is simplicity itself. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    \"use strict\";\r\n    alert(\"Look ma! Strict mode!\");\r\n\r\nThe nice thing here is that this is perfectly valid ECMAScript 3 code as well (ES3 is the previous edition of ECMAScript. What happened to ES4? It [went the way of the dodo!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Versions)). An ES3 JavaScript engine will simply ignore the noop line and proceed with running the rest of the script. In fact, this sort of syntactic backward compatibility with ES3 has been a key design goal for ES5 and a surprisingly large part of the ES5 specification can be implemented completely in ES3 JavaScript. Strict mode however, is an example of an ES5 feature that perhaps cannot be implemented purely in ES3 JavaScript without additional support from the runtime.\r\n\r\nThe following kinds of JavaScript code can be made to run under strict mode:\r\n\r\n1.  #### Global code\r\n\r\n    This is basically executable code that you enter inside a `script` tag. For example:\r\n\r\n        <script>\r\n          \"use strict\";\r\n          // global strict mode code here\r\n        </script>\r\n\r\n    Note that with HTML5, there is no longer a need to add the type attribute for script tags.\r\n\r\n2.  #### Eval code\r\n\r\n    Eval code that has the strict mode directive prefix:\r\n\r\n        eval(\"'use strict'; // strict code here\");\r\n\r\n    Or is invoked from strict mode code:\r\n\r\n        \"use strict\";\r\n        eval(\"// strict code here\");\r\n\r\n3.  #### Function code\r\n\r\n    Functions that have the strict mode directive prefixed before the rest of the code (putting the directive anywhere else doesn't count):\r\n\r\n        function foo() {\r\n            \"use strict\";\r\n            // strict code here\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    Functions declared in strict mode code inherit the strictness:\r\n\r\n        function foo() {\r\n            \"use strict\";\r\n            var bar = function () {\r\n                // strict code here\r\n            };\r\n            bar();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    Note that the latter case is particularly relevant when you are defining callbacks for various event handlers. Also, note that strictness does not extend across call stacks. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n        function foo() {\r\n            // not strict mode even though\r\n            // foo is being invoked from a\r\n            // \"strict\" function\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        function bar() {\r\n            \"use strict\";\r\n            foo();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        bar();\r\n\r\nIn the [next post](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-JavaScriptstrictmoderestrictio.aspx) we'll start taking a look at some of the restrictions that ES5 strict mode imposes on the language and how they help you write better JavaScript.\r\n","html":"<p>ECMAScript version 5 is the latest revision of the ECMAScript programming language ratified for widespread adoption by <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/\">Ecma International</a> - the standards body responsible for figuring out what goes into the language.

I decided to employ the [builder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) pattern a bit and set something up like this first:\r\n\r\n    //\r\n    // transform events collection\r\n    //\r\n    var transformTable = {\r\n        parseFileBegin : [],\r\n        parseLineBegin : [],\r\n        parseLineEnd : [],\r\n        parseFileEnd : []\r\n    };\r\n\r\nThe idea is to populate the arrays `parseFileBegin` and `parseFileEnd` with a set of function object references that would get called in sequence at the appropriate time. To make calling these callbacks easier I decided to come up with a `fireEvent` routine which I could then use to fire a particular set of callback functions. I wanted also, to be able to call `fireEvent` passing as many arguments as are needed for that particular callback. When invoking `parseFileBegin` for instance, I wanted to pass the name of the file as a parameter to the callback routines and when calling `parseLineBegin` I wanted to pass in a tokenized form of each line along with the line string itself. Here're a couple of examples of how I wanted to call `fireEvent`.\r\n\r\n    fireEvent(transformTable.parseFileBegin, fileName);\r\n    fireEvent(transformTable.parseLineBegin, line, tokens);\r\n\r\nAnd here's what I came up with for `fireEvent`:\r\n\r\n    function forEach( arr, cb ) {\r\n        for( var i = 0 ; i < arr.length ; ++i )\r\n            if( cb( arr[i] ) == false )\r\n                return false;\r\n\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function fireEvent(eventHandlers) {\r\n        //\r\n        // everything after the first argument must be\r\n        // considered as parameters to be passed to the\r\n        // event handler routines\r\n        //\r\n        var args = [];\r\n        var i = 0;\r\n        forEach(arguments, function( arg ) {\r\n            if( i++ == 0 )\r\n                return;\r\n            args.push( arg );\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        //\r\n        // iterate through the handlers collection and call one by one\r\n        //\r\n        forEach(eventHandlers, function(handler) {\r\n            // TODO: call the handler\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI needed to somehow call the function referenced by `handler` and pass all the values in the `args` array as parameters to it. One way might have been to dynamically build a string of JavaScript code that calls `handler` and then have it executed by calling `eval` on the string. But I perferred a more direct method if one were available. As it turned out, one was in fact available in the form of the `apply` method on `Function` objects. Consider this code:\r\n\r\n    var foo = function(s1, s2) {\r\n        alert( s1 + \" - \" + s2 );\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of ways you can invoke `foo`. You can call it as you normally would with functions or, alternatively, you can call the member method `apply` that all function objects posses. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    var foo = function(s1, s2) {\r\n        alert( s1 + \" - \" + s2 );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    foo(\"ding\", 20);                 // call like normal function\r\n    foo.apply( null, [\"ding\", 20] ); // call via \"apply\" method\r\n\r\nThe `apply` method requires you to supply 2 parameters, the first one indicates the object in whose scope the function must be invoked - which means that the function will be invoked as though it were a member function of that object. The effect of this is that the variable \"`this`\" within that function will refer to the object you pass as the first argument. If you pass `null` then it will execute like a global function. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    var person = {\r\n        name : \"binga\",\r\n        age : 20\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    var print = function() {\r\n        alert( this.name + \" - \" + this.age );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    print.apply( person );\r\n\r\nFrom within the function `print` here, the reference to \"`this`\" turns out to refer the first parameter that you pass to `apply`. So what happens if you called `print` like this?\r\n\r\n    print.apply( null );\r\n\r\nAs things tend to be in such cases, \"`this`\" becomes \"`undefined`\" from inside `print`.\r\n\r\nThe second parameter to `apply` is of course, the array of parameters that are to be passed to the function. So with this new information, `fireEvent` looks like this:\r\n\r\n    function fireEvent(eventHandlers) {\r\n        //\r\n        // everything after the first argument must be\r\n        // considered as parameters to be passed to the\r\n        // event handler routines\r\n        //\r\n        var args = [];\r\n        var i = 0;\r\n        forEach(arguments, function( arg ) {\r\n            if( i++ == 0 )\r\n                return;\r\n            args.push( arg );\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        //\r\n        // iterate through the handlers collection and call one by one\r\n        //\r\n        forEach(eventHandlers, function(handler) {\r\n            handler.apply(null, args);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSimple enough, when you know how to do it eh?!\r\n","html":"<p>I am working on this little <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Script_Host\">Windows Scripting Host</a> script using JavaScript where I basically need to load up a Word document and do a bunch of text transformation tasks on each line and dump the output to the console (which I plan to redirect to a file). I decided to employ the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern\">builder</a> pattern a bit and set something up like this first:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//\n// transform events collection\n//\nvar transformTable = {\n    parseFileBegin : [],\n    parseLineBegin : [],\n    parseLineEnd : [],\n    parseFileEnd : []\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The idea is to populate the arrays <code>parseFileBegin</code> and <code>parseFileEnd</code> with a set of function object references that would get called in sequence at the appropriate time. To make calling these callbacks easier I decided to come up with a <code>fireEvent</code> routine which I could then use to fire a particular set of callback functions. I wanted also, to be able to call <code>fireEvent</code> passing as many arguments as are needed for that particular callback. When invoking <code>parseFileBegin</code> for instance, I wanted to pass the name of the file as a parameter to the callback routines and when calling <code>parseLineBegin</code> I wanted to pass in a tokenized form of each line along with the line string itself. Here're a couple of examples of how I wanted to call <code>fireEvent</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>fireEvent(transformTable.parseFileBegin, fileName);\nfireEvent(transformTable.parseLineBegin, line, tokens);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here's what I came up with for <code>fireEvent</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function forEach( arr, cb ) {\n    for( var i = 0 ; i &lt; arr.length ; ++i )\n        if( cb( arr[i] ) == false )\n            return false;\n\n    return true;\n}\n\nfunction fireEvent(eventHandlers) {\n    //\n    // everything after the first argument must be\n    // considered as parameters to be passed to the\n    // event handler routines\n    //\n    var args = [];\n    var i = 0;\n    forEach(arguments, function( arg ) {\n        if( i++ == 0 )\n            return;\n        args.push( arg );\n    });\n\n    //\n    // iterate through the handlers collection and call one by one\n    //\n    forEach(eventHandlers, function(handler) {\n        // TODO: call the handler\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I needed to somehow call the function referenced by <code>handler</code> and pass all the values in the <code>args</code> array as parameters to it. One way might have been to dynamically build a string of JavaScript code that calls <code>handler</code> and then have it executed by calling <code>eval</code> on the string. But I perferred a more direct method if one were available. As it turned out, one was in fact available in the form of the <code>apply</code> method on <code>Function</code> objects. Consider this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var foo = function(s1, s2) {\n    alert( s1 + \" - \" + s2 );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are a couple of ways you can invoke <code>foo</code>. You can call it as you normally would with functions or, alternatively, you can call the member method <code>apply</code> that all function objects posses. Here's an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var foo = function(s1, s2) {\n    alert( s1 + \" - \" + s2 );\n}\n\nfoo(\"ding\", 20);                 // call like normal function\nfoo.apply( null, [\"ding\", 20] ); // call via \"apply\" method\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>apply</code> method requires you to supply 2 parameters, the first one indicates the object in whose scope the function must be invoked - which means that the function will be invoked as though it were a member function of that object. The effect of this is that the variable \"<code>this</code>\" within that function will refer to the object you pass as the first argument. If you pass <code>null</code> then it will execute like a global function. Here's an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var person = {\n    name : \"binga\",\n    age : 20\n};\n\nvar print = function() {\n    alert( this.name + \" - \" + this.age );\n}\n\nprint.apply( person );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>From within the function <code>print</code> here, the reference to \"<code>this</code>\" turns out to refer the first parameter that you pass to <code>apply</code>. So what happens if you called <code>print</code> like this?</p>\n\n<pre><code>print.apply( null );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As things tend to be in such cases, \"<code>this</code>\" becomes \"<code>undefined</code>\" from inside <code>print</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The second parameter to <code>apply</code> is of course, the array of parameters that are to be passed to the function.

Briefly, inheritance in JavaScript is \"prototypal\" in nature and instead of types inheriting from other types, we have object instances inheriting from other object instances. Being a weakly typed language, the traditional interpretation of inheritance as it applies to a static strongly typed language does not apply here. Each object in JavaScript has a hidden reference to another object called its \"prototype\". Member references (i.e. when you access a property like so: `obj.prop`) are resolved by the runtime by first looking the object itself up for the member and if not found then looking for it in the object's prototype. If the member is still not found then the prototype's prototype is inspected and so forth till the prototype of the root `Object` object is encountered at which point the member is declared as non-existent. The [blog post](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-InheritanceinJavaScript.aspx) I linked to earlier talks about this in detail.\r\n\r\nI am working on a project where I have an inheritance hierarchy such as the following:\r\n\r\n    var Base = Object.create({}, {\r\n        init: {\r\n            value: function() {\r\n                //\r\n                // default initialization here\r\n                //\r\n                print(\"Base.init\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    var Derived = Object.create(Base, {\r\n        //\r\n        // override init\r\n        //\r\n        init: {\r\n            value: function() {\r\n                //\r\n                // call base here\r\n                //\r\n                print(\"Derived.init\");\r\n                Object.getPrototypeOf(this).init.call(this);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    Derived.init();\r\n\r\nThis produces the following output:\r\n\r\n    Derived.init\r\n    Base.init\r\n\r\nThis makes sense because I am calling `init` on the `Derived` instance and calling `Object.getPrototypeOf` on `Derived` should return a reference to `Base` which we are subsequently able to use to invoke its (i.e. `Base`'s) version of `init`. Wanting to make the syntax a tad more natural I decided to extend `Object.prototype` to include an \"`uber`\" getter property that will return a reference to the \"base\" object from which the current object inherits. Here's what I came up with:\r\n\r\n    Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, \"uber\", {\r\n        get: function () {\r\n            return Object.getPrototypeOf(this);\r\n        },\r\n        enumerable: false,\r\n        configurable: false\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThis would now allow me to call the base like so:\r\n\r\n    var Derived = Object.create(Base, {\r\n        //\r\n        // override init\r\n        //\r\n        init: {\r\n            value: function() {\r\n                //\r\n                // call base here\r\n                //\r\n                print(\"Derived.init\");\r\n                this.uber.init.call(this);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    Derived.init();\r\n\r\nGreat. Now consider what happens in the following snippet:\r\n\r\n    var o1 = Object.create(Derived);\r\n    o1.init();\r\n\r\nFor all intents and purposes this perhaps looks like it should work (or it did so to me at least!). Turns out, this doesn't quite work the way we might expect it to. Let's step through what the JavaScript engine actually does when it encounters the call to `init` via `o1`.\r\n\r\n1.  Does `o1` have an \"own\" (see `Object.hasOwnProperty`) property called `init`? Nope, it does not.\r\n2.  Does `o1``s prototype have an \"own\" property called `init`? `o1``s prototype is `Derived` and it does indeed have a property called `init`. Great, invoke `Derived.init` using `o1` as the object context (`Derived.init.call(o1)`).\r\n3.  The problem arises when the JavaScript engine encounters line 2 of `Derived.init`. Remember that \"`this`\" here is a reference to `o1` and calling `Object.getPrototypeOf` on it is simply going to result in a reference to `Derived` being returned! So in effect, we are making a recursive call to `Derived.init`!\r\n\r\nTaking it to its logical conclusion it is easy to see that this code will result in `Derived.init` being called over and over again till the JS engine runs out of stack space.\r\n\r\n### Adding a teeny bit of type metadata\r\n\r\nIf you think about the problem a bit you learn that the fundamental issue has to do with being able to somehow map member functions with the specific object where it is defined in such a way that this mapping is programmatically accessible at runtime. For example, we need to be able to associate the object `Derived` with its implementation of the method `init`. And this association must somehow be made accessible from `Object.uber` so that it can return the correct prototype object reference. One rather straightforward way that we could perhaps achieve this is by simply passing `Derived `to `Object.uber`. Like so:\r\n\r\n    Object.prototype.uber = function (obj) {\r\n        return Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var Base = Object.create({}, {\r\n        init: {\r\n            value: function () {\r\n                //\r\n                // default initialization here\r\n                //\r\n                print(\"Base.init\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    var Derived = Object.create(Base, {\r\n        //\r\n        // override init\r\n        //\r\n        init: {\r\n            value: function () {\r\n                //\r\n                // call base here\r\n                //\r\n                print(\"Derived.init\");\r\n                this.uber(Derived).init.call(this);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    var o1 = Object.create(Derived);\r\n    o1.init()\r\n\r\nBut I really wanted to be able to just say `this.uber` instead of having to pass the reference to the object where the method in question has been defined. This however will be possible only if we extend `Object` to include some additional support routines. First we add a function called `inherit` that is defined like so:\r\n\r\n    Object.inherit = function (proto, props) {\r\n        var o = Object.create(proto, props);\r\n\r\n        Object.getOwnPropertyNames(o).forEach(function (pn) {\r\n            if (typeof (o[pn]) === \"function\")\r\n                o[pn][\"___type___\"] = o;\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        return o;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`Object.inherit` simply delegates to `Object.create` and performs one small activity in addition. It enumerates all the member methods in the newly created object and tacks on a property called `___type___` to them. This property will simply point back to the newly created object. This bit of metadata will then be used from `uber` to retrieve a reference to the object where the method in question was created. With this new bit of metadata handy we modify `uber` to look like this:\r\n\r\n    Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, \"uber\", {\r\n        get: function () {\r\n            var o = arguments.callee.caller[\"___type___\"];\r\n            if (!o) {\r\n                throw \"Uh oh! No metadata!\";\r\n            }\r\n            return Object.getPrototypeOf(o);\r\n        },\r\n        enumerable: false,\r\n        configurable: false\r\n    });\r\n\r\n`arguments.callee` refers to the current function, i.e., the function where the current line is executing. This is particularly useful in situations such as the above where the function in question is an anonymous function and there really isn't any other way to refer to it. Function objects have a magic property called `caller` that become available as they are executing. Here's a small sample that illustrates this:\r\n\r\n    function bar() {\r\n        print(bar.caller);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function foo() {\r\n        bar();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    foo();\r\n    print(bar.caller === null);\r\n\r\nHere's the output we get on running this snippet:\r\n\r\n    function foo() { bar(); }\r\n    true\r\n\r\nAs you can tell, outside of the call context `bar.caller `evaluates to `null` but while it is executing, it contains a reference to `foo` since `bar` was invoked from `foo`. We use this aspect of JS to access the function that invokes `uber `which in turn should contain a reference to the object where the function was defined via `___type___`. Once we get that object it's a simple matter of returning its prototype. With all this support infrastructure in place, code like the following should work just fine:\r\n\r\n    var Base = Object.inherit({}, {\r\n        init: {\r\n            value: function () {\r\n                //\r\n                // default initialization here\r\n                //\r\n                print(\"Base.init\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    var Derived = Object.inherit(Base, {\r\n        //\r\n        // override init\r\n        //\r\n        init: {\r\n            value: function () {\r\n                //\r\n                // call base here\r\n                //\r\n                print(\"Derived.init\");\r\n                this.uber.init.call(this);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    var MoreDerived = Object.inherit(Derived, {\r\n        init: {\r\n            value: function () {\r\n                print(\"MoreDerived.init\");\r\n                this.uber.init.call(this);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    //\r\n    // create instances that inherit from MoreDerived\r\n    //\r\n    var o1 = Object.create(MoreDerived);\r\n    var o2 = Object.create(o1);\r\n    o2.init();\r\n\r\nHere's the output this produces:\r\n\r\n    MoreDerived.init\r\n    Derived.init\r\n    Base.init\r\n\r\nOK, but what happens if somebody tacks on a new member method or overrides an existing one *after* `Object.inherit`? Will `this.uber` work from that method? Clearly, it won't because the hidden `___type___` member is added to the member functions only from `Object.``inherit`. This means that we're going to have to add another little utility to `Object` that wraps this little functionality. Here goes:\r\n\r\n    Object.override = function (o, name, fn) {\r\n        Object.defineProperty(o, name, {\r\n            value: fn\r\n        });\r\n        fn[\"___type___\"] = o;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow, we can add new member methods to objects using this function. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    var o1 = Object.create(MoreDerived);\r\n    Object.override(o1, \"init\", function () {\r\n        print(\"o1.init\");\r\n        this.uber.init.call(this);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    var o2 = Object.create(o1);\r\n    Object.override(o2, \"init\", function () {\r\n        print(\"o2.init\");\r\n        this.uber.init.call(this);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    o2.init();\r\n\r\nAnd here's the output we get:\r\n\r\n    o2.init\r\n    o1.init\r\n    MoreDerived.init\r\n    Derived.init\r\n    Base.init\r\n\r\nThat's it. As long as we use `Object.inherit` and `Object.override` to create our derived instances and to override methods respectively, we can confidently use `this.uber` to refer to the correct parent prototype object at all times!\r\n","html":"<p>I <a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-InheritanceinJavaScript.aspx\">wrote a little bit</a> about how inheritance was designed to work in JavaScript sometime back. Briefly, inheritance in JavaScript is \"prototypal\" in nature and instead of types inheriting from other types, we have object instances inheriting from other object instances. Being a weakly typed language, the traditional interpretation of inheritance as it applies to a static strongly typed language does not apply here. Each object in JavaScript has a hidden reference to another object called its \"prototype\". Member references (i.e. when you access a property like so: <code>obj.prop</code>) are resolved by the runtime by first looking the object itself up for the member and if not found then looking for it in the object's prototype. If the member is still not found then the prototype's prototype is inspected and so forth till the prototype of the root <code>Object</code> object is encountered at which point the member is declared as non-existent. The <a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-InheritanceinJavaScript.aspx\">blog post</a> I linked to earlier talks about this in detail.</p>\n\n<p>I am working on a project where I have an inheritance hierarchy such as the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Base = Object.create({}, {\n    init: {\n        value: function() {\n            //\n            // default initialization here\n            //\n            print(\"Base.init\");\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nvar Derived = Object.create(Base, {\n    //\n    // override init\n    //\n    init: {\n        value: function() {\n            //\n            // call base here\n            //\n            print(\"Derived.init\");\n            Object.getPrototypeOf(this).init.call(this);\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nDerived.init();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This produces the following output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Derived.init\nBase.init\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This makes sense because I am calling <code>init</code> on the <code>Derived</code> instance and calling <code>Object.getPrototypeOf</code> on <code>Derived</code> should return a reference to <code>Base</code> which we are subsequently able to use to invoke its (i.e. <code>Base</code>'s) version of <code>init</code>. Wanting to make the syntax a tad more natural I decided to extend <code>Object.prototype</code> to include an \"<code>uber</code>\" getter property that will return a reference to the \"base\" object from which the current object inherits. Here's what I came up with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, \"uber\", {\n    get: function () {\n        return Object.getPrototypeOf(this);\n    },\n    enumerable: false,\n    configurable: false\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This would now allow me to call the base like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Derived = Object.create(Base, {\n    //\n    // override init\n    //\n    init: {\n        value: function() {\n            //\n            // call base here\n            //\n            print(\"Derived.init\");\n            this.uber.init.call(this);\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nDerived.init();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Great. Now consider what happens in the following snippet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var o1 = Object.create(Derived);\no1.init();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For all intents and purposes this perhaps looks like it should work (or it did so to me at least!). Turns out, this doesn't quite work the way we might expect it to. Let's step through what the JavaScript engine actually does when it encounters the call to <code>init</code> via <code>o1</code>.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Does <code>o1</code> have an \"own\" (see <code>Object.hasOwnProperty</code>) property called <code>init</code>? Nope, it does not.  </li>\n<li>Does <code>o1``s prototype have an \"own\" property called</code>init<code>?</code>o1<code>`s prototype is</code>Derived<code>and it does indeed have a property called</code>init<code>. Great, invoke</code>Derived.init<code>using</code>o1<code>as the object context (</code>Derived.init.call(o1)`).  </li>\n<li>The problem arises when the JavaScript engine encounters line 2 of <code>Derived.init</code>. Remember that \"<code>this</code>\" here is a reference to <code>o1</code> and calling <code>Object.getPrototypeOf</code> on it is simply going to result in a reference to <code>Derived</code> being returned! So in effect, we are making a recursive call to <code>Derived.init</code>!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Taking it to its logical conclusion it is easy to see that this code will result in <code>Derived.init</code> being called over and over again till the JS engine runs out of stack space.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"addingateenybitoftypemetadata\">Adding a teeny bit of type metadata</h3>\n\n<p>If you think about the problem a bit you learn that the fundamental issue has to do with being able to somehow map member functions with the specific object where it is defined in such a way that this mapping is programmatically accessible at runtime. For example, we need to be able to associate the object <code>Derived</code> with its implementation of the method <code>init</code>. And this association must somehow be made accessible from <code>Object.uber</code> so that it can return the correct prototype object reference. One rather straightforward way that we could perhaps achieve this is by simply passing <code>Derived</code>to <code>Object.uber</code>. Like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Object.prototype.uber = function (obj) {\n    return Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);\n}\n\nvar Base = Object.create({}, {\n    init: {\n        value: function () {\n            //\n            // default initialization here\n            //\n            print(\"Base.init\");\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nvar Derived = Object.create(Base, {\n    //\n    // override init\n    //\n    init: {\n        value: function () {\n            //\n            // call base here\n            //\n            print(\"Derived.init\");\n            this.uber(Derived).init.call(this);\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nvar o1 = Object.create(Derived);\no1.init()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I really wanted to be able to just say <code>this.uber</code> instead of having to pass the reference to the object where the method in question has been defined. This however will be possible only if we extend <code>Object</code> to include some additional support routines. First we add a function called <code>inherit</code> that is defined like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Object.inherit = function (proto, props) {\n    var o = Object.create(proto, props);\n\n    Object.getOwnPropertyNames(o).forEach(function (pn) {\n        if (typeof (o[pn]) === \"function\")\n            o[pn][\"___type___\"] = o;\n    });\n\n    return o;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>Object.inherit</code> simply delegates to <code>Object.create</code> and performs one small activity in addition. It enumerates all the member methods in the newly created object and tacks on a property called <code>___type___</code> to them. This property will simply point back to the newly created object. This bit of metadata will then be used from <code>uber</code> to retrieve a reference to the object where the method in question was created. With this new bit of metadata handy we modify <code>uber</code> to look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, \"uber\", {\n    get: function () {\n        var o = arguments.callee.caller[\"___type___\"];\n        if (!o) {\n            throw \"Uh oh! No metadata!\";\n        }\n        return Object.getPrototypeOf(o);\n    },\n    enumerable: false,\n    configurable: false\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>arguments.callee</code> refers to the current function, i.e., the function where the current line is executing. This is particularly useful in situations such as the above where the function in question is an anonymous function and there really isn't any other way to refer to it. Function objects have a magic property called <code>caller</code> that become available as they are executing. Here's a small sample that illustrates this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function bar() {\n    print(bar.caller);\n}\n\nfunction foo() {\n    bar();\n}\n\nfoo();\nprint(bar.caller === null);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's the output we get on running this snippet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function foo() { bar(); }\ntrue\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can tell, outside of the call context <code>bar.caller</code>evaluates to <code>null</code> but while it is executing, it contains a reference to <code>foo</code> since <code>bar</code> was invoked from <code>foo</code>. We use this aspect of JS to access the function that invokes <code>uber</code>which in turn should contain a reference to the object where the function was defined via <code>___type___</code>. Once we get that object it's a simple matter of returning its prototype. With all this support infrastructure in place, code like the following should work just fine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Base = Object.inherit({}, {\n    init: {\n        value: function () {\n            //\n            // default initialization here\n            //\n            print(\"Base.init\");\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nvar Derived = Object.inherit(Base, {\n    //\n    // override init\n    //\n    init: {\n        value: function () {\n            //\n            // call base here\n            //\n            print(\"Derived.init\");\n            this.uber.init.call(this);\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nvar MoreDerived = Object.inherit(Derived, {\n    init: {\n        value: function () {\n            print(\"MoreDerived.init\");\n            this.uber.init.call(this);\n        }\n    }\n});\n\n//\n// create instances that inherit from MoreDerived\n//\nvar o1 = Object.create(MoreDerived);\nvar o2 = Object.create(o1);\no2.init();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's the output this produces:</p>\n\n<pre><code>MoreDerived.init\nDerived.init\nBase.init\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>OK, but what happens if somebody tacks on a new member method or overrides an existing one <em>after</em> <code>Object.inherit</code>? Will <code>this.uber</code> work from that method? Clearly, it won't because the hidden <code>___type___</code> member is added to the member functions only from <code>Object.``inherit</code>.

In the typical OO static language, inheritance is applied to \"classes\" which are essentially templates for how an object instance should be laid out in memory at runtime. JavaScript however is weakly typed, i.e. pretty much everything is an \"object\". How will inheritance work out in a weakly typed dynamic language such as JavaScript? Enter \"*prototypal inheritance*\"!\n\n### Prototypal Inheritance\n\nSomewhat counter-intuitively, inheritance in JavaScript applies to object instances instead of types. I know that sounds kind of weird but once we see how it works, it actually turns out to be quite elegant. Every object has a hidden default member called its \"prototype\". The prototype of an object is a simple reference to another object which in turn has its own prototype reference to yet another object. Here's a picture illustrating this:\n\n> ![Image depicting prototype object linkage.](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/proto.png)\n\nHere, `object1`'s prototype points to `object2` and `object2`'s prototype points to the prototype of the JavaScript `Object` type (part of the JavaScript library). The `Object` type's prototype does not in turn point to yet another object and is always `null` thereby making it the root object in the inheritance hierarchy.\n\nWhenever you attempt to access a member field or method on an object the JavaScript runtime attempts to locate the member directly on the object. If the lookup fails then it attempts to locate the member in the object's prototype and continues to walk the prototype chain till the member is found (if the member ends up never being found then you get a syntax error or an \"undefined\" reference depending on the context). Here's a pseudo-implementation of member lookup implemented in JavaScript:\n\n    //\n    // dereferences the member identified by \"memid\"\n    // if it exists directly on the object; returns\n    // \"null\" otherwise\n    //\n    Object.prototype.getOwnProperty = function (memid) {\n        if (this.hasOwnProperty(memid))\n            return this[memid];\n        return null;\n    };\n\n    //\n    // lookup member property/method called \"memid\" on object\n    // \"obj\"; walks the prototype inheritance chain till member\n    // is found; returns \"null\" if member is not found\n    //\n    function lookup(obj, memid) {\n        var mem = obj.getOwnProperty(memid);\n        while (!mem) {\n            obj = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);\n            if (!obj)\n                break;\n            mem = obj.getOwnProperty(memid);\n        }\n\n        return mem;\n    }\n\n### So how does prototypal inheritance work?\n\nSo how exactly do you do prototypal inheritance? The basic idea is that new objects are created by copying the structure of an existing prototype object (see [prototype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern) creational design pattern). Here's another bit of JavaScript pseudo-code that shows how this might work:\n\n    var person_proto = {\n        name: \"no name\",\n        age: 0\n    };\n\n    var o = {};\n    o.prototype = person_proto; // this won't actually work!\n\nPlease note that the above actually won't work the way you intend it to if you run it (it will simply create a new property called \"prototype\" on \"`o`\"!). The object \"`o`\"'s prototype will not get set. In fact JavaScript does not provide a mechanism to assign a value to an object instance's prototype (Mozilla and WebKit browsers do however permit this via a special extension property named `__proto__` - but this is not a part of the ECMAScript standard and should not be relied upon). Having said that, in essence, what has been given above is what happens when you inherit prototypally. Here, \"`o`\" is a new object whose prototype is a reference to another object (`person_proto`). When you access the `name` property like so:\n\n    print(o.name);\n\nThe JavaScript engine would actually resolve the \"name\" property on the object's prototype since the object itself does not have a property called \"name\". But since the JavaScript language does not allow one to assign the prototype on an object instance how can we achieve this sort of inheritance in a standards compliant manner? [Douglas Crockford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford) has discussed precisely this in his [blog post](http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html) on prototypal inheritance. His solution basically takes advantage of the fact that while you cannot assign the prototype of an object instance you can in fact assign the prototype on a `Function` object. Here's a utility routine that allows us to inherit prototypally from another object.\n\n    function inherit(o) {\n        function F() {}\n        F.prototype = o;\n        return new F();\n    }\n\nAnd here's some code that shows how we'd use this function to inherit from the `             person_proto` object defined in the previous snippet:\n\n    var gender_person = inherit(person_proto);\n    gender_person.gender = \"f\";\n\nNote that I have also extended the `gender_person` object by tacking on the `gender` property to it. Imagine that I wish to inherit another object from `gender_person` and add a \"`married`\" boolean member field to it. Here's how I'd go about it.\n\n    var marital_person = inherit(gender_person);\n    marital_person.married = false;\n\nHere's the inheritance chain depicted pictorially:\n\n> ![Inheritance chain of sample object.](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/proto-inherit.png)\n\nNote that the inheritance relationship is completely between object instances and not types. Also note the following aspects of this style of programming:\n\n-   Each \"inherit\" operation is essentially an object instantiation.\n-   Each \"inherit\" seems to be always accompanied with the definition of new members on the new object.\n\n[ECMAScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) version 5 therefore adds a new function called [`Object.create`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff925952(v=VS.94).aspx) that does exactly this. Here's the same example done using `Object.create` instead of our homebrewed `inherit`.\n\n    //\n    // create basic person prototype object; this\n    // object's prototype will be equal to Object.prototype\n    //\n    var person_proto = {\n        name: \"no name\",\n        age: 0\n    };\n\n    //\n    // inherit from \"person_proto\" and add a new member\n    // field called \"gender\"\n    //\n    var gender_person = Object.create(person_proto, {\n        gender: {\n            value: \"f\",\n            writable: true,\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        }\n    });\n\n    //\n    // inherit from \"gender_person\" and add a new member\n    // field called \"married\"\n    //\n    var marital_person = Object.create(gender_person, {\n        married: {\n            value: false,\n            writable: true,\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        }\n    });\n\n    for(var i in marital_person)\n        print(sprintf(\"marital_person.%s = %s\", i, marital_person[i]));\n\nHere's the output we get when we run this snippet (you can try it in the [Eval](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-JavaScriptevalconsole.aspx) console yourself if you like - just make sure that you're running a browser that has support for ECMAScript 5 - which is most modern browsers).\n\n    marital_person.married = false\n    marital_person.gender = f\n    marital_person.name = no name\n    marital_person.age = 0\n\nIts interesting to observe that when you use `for...in` to reflect on an object it seems to walk the prototype chain bottom up. In the output above, it printed the properties on `marital_person` first, then `gender_person` and finally `proto_person`. This prototypal nature of the language is what enables you to do powerful things such as adding new members to even core library types such as `Object`, `String`, `Array` etc. When you add a new `trim` function to `String.prototype` for instance, it automagically shows up not just on new string objects created henceforth but on all string instances that are alive at that point in time! This is made possible because during the actual member resolution process the runtime walks the prototype chain to locate it before giving up.\n\n### But I want my new!\n\nWhat I have described so far is the way inheritance was designed to work in JavaScript. Desiring to cater to developers who are familiar with static languages such as Java (which was really taking off at the time JavaScript was introduced), Netscape decided to make the unfortunate choice of simulating classical object instantiation and type inheritance behavior by introducing [syntactic sugar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) (or maybe it should be called *syntactic salt*!) that hid the prototypal nature from the programmer. The end result is a construct that ends up being not quite classical inheritance while deliberately misleading the developer on what's actually happening under the covers! Its fairly common to see code such as the following today:\n\n    function Person(n, a) {\n        this.name = n;\n        this.age = a;\n    }\n\n    var p = new Person(\"Foo\", 10);\n\nIts interesting to see what is actually happening under the covers when you \"new\" up an object. Here's the last line of the snippet given above \"expanded\" to the actual instructions being run under the covers in pseudocode form.\n\n    var p = {};                     // create empty object\n\n    p.prototype = Person.prototype; // assign prototype (as before\n                                    // this won't actually set the\n                                    // prototype)\n\n    Person.call(p, \"Foo\", 10);      // run constructor on object\n\nBriefly, an empty object gets created and its prototype gets assigned to `Person`'s prototype and the constructor function is invoked using the new object as its context. It is self-evident that there really isn't a \"type\" called \"`Person`\". The language just allows the developer to pretend like there is! In fact it even provides an \"`instanceof`\" operator that you can use to verify if an object is an instance of a particular \"type\". Here's how you use it\n\n    function Person(n, a) {\n        this.name = n;\n        this.age = a;\n    }\n\n    var p = new Person(\"Foo\", 10);\n    print(p instanceof Person); // prints \"true\"\n\nWhat the operator does is to check if the prototype of the constructor function (`Person` in the snippet above) figures in the object's prototype chain. Here's a possible naive implementation of the \"`instanceof`\" operator as a JavaScript function with some sample usage:\n\n    function instanceOf(o, t) {\n        if(typeof(t) !== \"function\")\n            throw \"Pass a Function object for type name.\";\n        if(typeof(o) !== \"object\")\n            throw \"Object must not be a primitive type.\";\n        var proto = t.prototype;\n        var op = Object.getPrototypeOf(o);\n        while(op) {\n            if(proto === op)\n                return true;\n            op = Object.getPrototypeOf(op);\n        }\n\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    function Person(n, a) {\n        this.name = n;\n        this.age = a;\n    }\n\n    var p = new Person(\"Foo\", 10);\n    print(instanceOf(p, Person)); // prints \"true\"\n\nWith that we conclude our brief review of how inheritance was designed to work in JavaScript. I have deliberately not discussed how we can simulate classical inheritance patterns in JavaScript though that is very much possible. Douglas Crockford has covered this topic in [this article](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html) but he ended up adding the following footnote to it - presumably many years after he'd written that article (emphasis mine):\n\n> I have been writing JavaScript for 8 years now, and I have never once found need to use an `uber` function. The `super` idea is fairly important in the classical pattern, but it appears to be unnecessary in the prototypal and functional patterns. **I now see my early attempts to support the classical model in JavaScript as a mistake**.","html":"<p>JavaScript adopts a radically different take on inheritance from what one is perhaps used to coming from an object oriented, statically typed language world such as C++, C# or Java. In the typical OO static language, inheritance is applied to \"classes\" which are essentially templates for how an object instance should be laid out in memory at runtime. JavaScript however is weakly typed, i.e. pretty much everything is an \"object\". How will inheritance work out in a weakly typed dynamic language such as JavaScript? Enter \"<em>prototypal inheritance</em>\"!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"prototypalinheritance\">Prototypal Inheritance</h3>\n\n<p>Somewhat counter-intuitively, inheritance in JavaScript applies to object instances instead of types. I know that sounds kind of weird but once we see how it works, it actually turns out to be quite elegant. Every object has a hidden default member called its \"prototype\". The prototype of an object is a simple reference to another object which in turn has its own prototype reference to yet another object. Here's a picture illustrating this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/proto.png\" alt=\"Image depicting prototype object linkage.\" title=\"\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, <code>object1</code>'s prototype points to <code>object2</code> and <code>object2</code>'s prototype points to the prototype of the JavaScript <code>Object</code> type (part of the JavaScript library). The <code>Object</code> type's prototype does not in turn point to yet another object and is always <code>null</code> thereby making it the root object in the inheritance hierarchy.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever you attempt to access a member field or method on an object the JavaScript runtime attempts to locate the member directly on the object. If the lookup fails then it attempts to locate the member in the object's prototype and continues to walk the prototype chain till the member is found (if the member ends up never being found then you get a syntax error or an \"undefined\" reference depending on the context). Here's a pseudo-implementation of member lookup implemented in JavaScript:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//\n// dereferences the member identified by \"memid\"\n// if it exists directly on the object; returns\n// \"null\" otherwise\n//\nObject.prototype.getOwnProperty = function (memid) {\n    if (this.hasOwnProperty(memid))\n        return this[memid];\n    return null;\n};\n\n//\n// lookup member property/method called \"memid\" on object\n// \"obj\"; walks the prototype inheritance chain till member\n// is found; returns \"null\" if member is not found\n//\nfunction lookup(obj, memid) {\n    var mem = obj.getOwnProperty(memid);\n    while (!mem) {\n        obj = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);\n        if (!obj)\n            break;\n        mem = obj.getOwnProperty(memid);\n    }\n\n    return mem;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"sohowdoesprototypalinheritancework\">So how does prototypal inheritance work?</h3>\n\n<p>So how exactly do you do prototypal inheritance? The basic idea is that new objects are created by copying the structure of an existing prototype object (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern\">prototype</a> creational design pattern). Here's another bit of JavaScript pseudo-code that shows how this might work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var person_proto = {\n    name: \"no name\",\n    age: 0\n};\n\nvar o = {};\no.prototype = person_proto; // this won't actually work!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please note that the above actually won't work the way you intend it to if you run it (it will simply create a new property called \"prototype\" on \"<code>o</code>\"!). The object \"<code>o</code>\"'s prototype will not get set. In fact JavaScript does not provide a mechanism to assign a value to an object instance's prototype (Mozilla and WebKit browsers do however permit this via a special extension property named <code>__proto__</code> - but this is not a part of the ECMAScript standard and should not be relied upon). Having said that, in essence, what has been given above is what happens when you inherit prototypally. Here, \"<code>o</code>\" is a new object whose prototype is a reference to another object (<code>person_proto</code>). When you access the <code>name</code> property like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>print(o.name);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The JavaScript engine would actually resolve the \"name\" property on the object's prototype since the object itself does not have a property called \"name\". But since the JavaScript language does not allow one to assign the prototype on an object instance how can we achieve this sort of inheritance in a standards compliant manner? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford\">Douglas Crockford</a> has discussed precisely this in his <a href=\"http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html\">blog post</a> on prototypal inheritance. His solution basically takes advantage of the fact that while you cannot assign the prototype of an object instance you can in fact assign the prototype on a <code>Function</code> object. Here's a utility routine that allows us to inherit prototypally from another object.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function inherit(o) {\n    function F() {}\n    F.prototype = o;\n    return new F();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here's some code that shows how we'd use this function to inherit from the <code>person_proto</code> object defined in the previous snippet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var gender_person = inherit(person_proto);\ngender_person.gender = \"f\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that I have also extended the <code>gender_person</code> object by tacking on the <code>gender</code> property to it. Imagine that I wish to inherit another object from <code>gender_person</code> and add a \"<code>married</code>\" boolean member field to it. Here's how I'd go about it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var marital_person = inherit(gender_person);\nmarital_person.married = false;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's the inheritance chain depicted pictorially:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/proto-inherit.png\" alt=\"Inheritance chain of sample object.\" title=\"\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the inheritance relationship is completely between object instances and not types. Also note the following aspects of this style of programming:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Each \"inherit\" operation is essentially an object instantiation.</li>\n<li>Each \"inherit\" seems to be always accompanied with the definition of new members on the new object.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript\">ECMAScript</a> version 5 therefore adds a new function called <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff925952(v=VS.94).aspx\"><code>Object.create</code></a> that does exactly this. Here's the same example done using <code>Object.create</code> instead of our homebrewed <code>inherit</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>//\n// create basic person prototype object; this\n// object's prototype will be equal to Object.prototype\n//\nvar person_proto = {\n    name: \"no name\",\n    age: 0\n};\n\n//\n// inherit from \"person_proto\" and add a new member\n// field called \"gender\"\n//\nvar gender_person = Object.create(person_proto, {\n    gender: {\n        value: \"f\",\n        writable: true,\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    }\n});\n\n//\n// inherit from \"gender_person\" and add a new member\n// field called \"married\"\n//\nvar marital_person = Object.create(gender_person, {\n    married: {\n        value: false,\n        writable: true,\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    }\n});\n\nfor(var i in marital_person)\n    print(sprintf(\"marital_person.%s = %s\", i, marital_person[i]));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's the output we get when we run this snippet (you can try it in the <a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-JavaScriptevalconsole.aspx\">Eval</a> console yourself if you like - just make sure that you're running a browser that has support for ECMAScript 5 - which is most modern browsers).</p>\n\n<pre><code>marital_person.married = false\nmarital_person.gender = f\nmarital_person.name = no name\nmarital_person.age = 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Its interesting to observe that when you use <code>for...in</code> to reflect on an object it seems to walk the prototype chain bottom up. In the output above, it printed the properties on <code>marital_person</code> first, then <code>gender_person</code> and finally <code>proto_person</code>. This prototypal nature of the language is what enables you to do powerful things such as adding new members to even core library types such as <code>Object</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Array</code> etc. When you add a new <code>trim</code> function to <code>String.prototype</code> for instance, it automagically shows up not just on new string objects created henceforth but on all string instances that are alive at that point in time! This is made possible because during the actual member resolution process the runtime walks the prototype chain to locate it before giving up.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"butiwantmynew\">But I want my new!</h3>\n\n<p>What I have described so far is the way inheritance was designed to work in JavaScript. Desiring to cater to developers who are familiar with static languages such as Java (which was really taking off at the time JavaScript was introduced), Netscape decided to make the unfortunate choice of simulating classical object instantiation and type inheritance behavior by introducing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar\">syntactic sugar</a> (or maybe it should be called <em>syntactic salt</em>!) that hid the prototypal nature from the programmer. The end result is a construct that ends up being not quite classical inheritance while deliberately misleading the developer on what's actually happening under the covers! Its fairly common to see code such as the following today:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Person(n, a) {\n    this.name = n;\n    this.age = a;\n}\n\nvar p = new Person(\"Foo\", 10);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Its interesting to see what is actually happening under the covers when you \"new\" up an object.

It is self-evident that there really isn't a \"type\" called \"<code>Person</code>\". The language just allows the developer to pretend like there is!

Today we review some of the key restrictions that become applicable when strict mode is active.\r\n\r\n1.  #### Identifiers must be declared before they can be assigned to\r\n\r\n    This aspect in my opinion makes strict mode worthwhile all on its own even if there was nothing more to it. Undeclared variable assignments do not automatically get added as expando properties on the global object.\r\n\r\n        \"use strict\";\r\n        foo = 10; // ReferenceError: Variable undefined in strict mode\r\n\r\n    With this in place, the following snippet that I'd given in the [first post](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-OnJavaScriptstrictmode.aspx) under the \"What is strict mode?\" section will fail to run and throw a \"ReferenceError\" instead because of the typo in the variable name \"product\" in the assignment inside the \"for\" loop.\r\n\r\n        function findProduct(numbers) {\r\n            \"use strict\";\r\n            var product = 0,\r\n                len = numbers.length;\r\n            for(var i = 0; i < len; ++i) {\r\n                prodct = product * numbers[i]; // ReferenceError: Variable undefined in strict mode\r\n            }\r\n            return product;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n2.  #### No automatic context for context-less function calls\r\n\r\n    Functions that are called without setting an explicit context do not automatically get the \"global object\" in \"this\". Consider the following snippet:\r\n\r\n        function foo() {\r\n            // prints \"true\"\r\n            print(this === window);\r\n        }\r\n        foo();\r\n\r\n    Here, \"foo\" is being invoked without setting an explicit context object, i.e., we are not calling it like so:\r\n\r\n        foo.call({foo: \"bar\"});\r\n\r\n    In unrestricted mode this causes the context to be automatically initialized to the \"global\" object, which in browsers is the \"window\" object. Since the snippet above was running in unrestricted mode, the expression \"this === window\" evaluates to true. If we modify the function like so however, we see that \"this\" is no longer equal to \"window\":\r\n\r\n        function foo() {\r\n            \"use strict\";\r\n            // prints \"false\"\r\n            print(this === window);\r\n        }\r\n        foo();\r\n\r\n3.  #### Reserved keywords cannot be identifier names\r\n\r\n    Naming variables and functions as `eval`, `arguments`, `implements`, `let`, `private`, `public`, `yield`, `interface`, `package`, `protected` and `static` will cause errors.\r\n\r\n        \"use strict\";\r\n        var yield; // SyntaxError: Expected identifier\r\n\r\n4.  #### Violations of ES5 property configuration cause errors\r\n\r\n    Violations of the configuration as specified in the property descriptor for ES5 properties will cause errors to be thrown in strict mode instead of them being silently ignored. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n    1.  *Writing to a non-writable property:*\r\n\r\n            \"use strict\";\r\n            var person = Object.create({}, {\r\n                name: {\r\n                    value: \"foo\",\r\n                    writable: false,\r\n                    configurable: true,\r\n                    enumerable: true\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            // TypeError: Assignment to read only properties not allowed in \r\n            // strict mode\r\n            person.name = \"bar\";\r\n\r\n        Note the line highlighted in bold. Setting the \"writable\" property descriptor to \"false\" makes the \"name\" property of the \"person\" object read-only. Attempts to assign to this property will be silently ignored in unrestricted mode but causes a \"TypeError\" to be thrown in strict mode.\r\n\r\n    2.  *Changing configuration of a non-configurable property:*\r\n\r\n            \"use strict\";\r\n            var person = Object.create({}, {\r\n                name: {\r\n                    value: \"foo\",\r\n                    writable: false,\r\n                    configurable: false,\r\n                    enumerable: true\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            // TypeError: Cannot redefine non-configurable property 'name'\r\n            Object.defineProperty(person, \"name\", {\r\n                value: \"bar\",\r\n                writable: true,\r\n                configurable: true,\r\n                enumerable: true\r\n            });\r\n\r\n        Here we attempted to change the property descriptor on a non-configurable object. Again, an error that would have gone unnoticed in unrestricted mode results in a \"TypeError\" being thrown in strict mode.\r\n\r\n5.  #### Writing to read-only accessor properties\r\n\r\n    Writing to accessor properties that do not have a \"setter\" defined causes errors to be thrown instead of being silently ignored:\r\n\r\n        \"use strict\";\r\n        var person = Object.create({}, {\r\n            name: {\r\n                get: function() {\r\n                    return \"foo\";\r\n                },\r\n                configurable: false,\r\n                enumerable: true\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        // TypeError\r\n        person.name = \"bar\";\r\n\r\n    Here, \"name\" is an accessor property that does not have a \"setter\" method defined. Attempts to assign a value to this property results in an error in strict mode while being quietly ignored in unrestricted mode.\r\n\r\n6.  #### Cannot extend non-extensible objects\r\n\r\n    Extending a non-extensible object throws an error in strict mode instead of being silently ignored:\r\n\r\n        \"use strict\";\r\n        var person = {\r\n            name: \"foo\"\r\n        };\r\n        Object.preventExtensions(person);\r\n\r\n        // TypeError: Cannot create property for a non-extensible object\r\n        person.age = 10;\r\n\r\n7.  #### Other sundry restrictions\r\n\r\n    There are a few other sundry restrictions for strict mode code which are perhaps somewhat less frequently used. I have briefly reviewed them below:\r\n\r\n    1.  Numeric constants are no longer interpreted as having an octal base if you put a leading zero.\r\n\r\n    2.  Variable/function instantiations in strict mode \"eval\" code occur in an environment that is local to the \"eval\" code and not in the environment of the calling code. This means that \"eval\" code cannot introduce new identifiers in the caller's execution context/scope.\r\n\r\n    3.  \"arguments\" is immutable, i.e., you cannot arbitrarily extend the \"arguments\" object by tacking on your own properties to it. Now why anyone would even want to do this is puzzling to me but it must have been happening often enough for Ecma to take the effort to specify that you can no longer do it in strict mode!\r\n\r\n    4.  \"arguments.callee\" and \"arguments.caller\" are not available in strict functions. I cannot say that I am completely happy with this particular restriction!\r\n\r\n    5.  Creating duplicate property definitions on an object is not allowed in strict mode code. The following snippet for instance, produces an error in strict mode:\r\n\r\n            \"use strict\";\r\n            var o = Object.create({}, {\r\n                name: {\r\n                    value: \"foo\"\r\n                },\r\n                name: {\r\n                    value: \"bar\"\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n\r\n        This code throws up a \"SyntaxError\" with the message, \"*Multiple definitions of a property not allowed in strict mode*\". In unrestricted mode, \"o.name\" would have the value \"bar\".\r\n\r\n    6.  Calling \"delete\" on an ES5 property which has its \"configurable\" property set to \"false\" results in an error being thrown in strict mode. This is a variation on the restriction discussed in point 4 above.\r\n\r\n    7.  The JavaScript \"with\" statement is not allowed in strict mode code.\r\n\r\n    8.  It is not allowed to create functions with duplicate parameter names in strict mode. Again, it defies logic as to why anyone would want to do this but there it is!\r\n\r\n### Some best practices\r\n\r\nHere are some things that you should perhaps consider while writing code that uses strict mode:\r\n\r\n1.  Given that \"strict mode\" is a fairly recent phenomenon, unless all your users have been conscientiously updating their favorite browser to a new version, chances are high that you will have some percentage of visitors to your web app who are running a JS engine that does not understand \"strict mode\". This means that basically all of your code is going to run in unrestricted mode regardless of whether or not you've used the strict mode directive. It becomes important therefore to always test your code in unrestricted mode and make sure that everything is still peachy.\r\n\r\n2.  Now, even if a major chunk of your end users are on browsers that don't support strict mode it still makes sense to use strict mode in your development environment because a large part of strict mode is about enforcing JavaScript development best practices and you can benefit from automated enforcement at least during development. Just make sure that you test everything in unrestricted mode before going live!\r\n\r\n3.  Enable strict mode in small increments instead of a one-shot quick fix. If you have a 3000 line JS file for instance, it is probably not wise to simply add the `\"use strict\";` directive at the top of the file as the semantic differences between the two modes can potentially result in subtle unforeseen bugs. Do it in smaller chunks at a function level and certainly use it with abandon for new code that you write.\r\n\r\nI'd encourage you to experiment and read up on strict mode. In my opinion, this is one of the best features introduced as part of ES5. Here are some resources that you are likely to find useful:\r\n\r\n-   [IE10 Platform Preview developer guide documentation on strict mode](http://bit.ly/qOpOa7)\r\n-   [Strict mode demo on IE test drive](http://bit.ly/opO8bw)\r\n-   [Article on ES5 strict mode in Firefox 4](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/01/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-in-firefox-4/) - has good information about strict mode in general\r\n-   [The venerable ES5 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) - doesn't exactly make for exhilarating reading but nothing like quoting the spec to nail an argument!\r\n\r\nWith that we come to a close of the two part series on JavaScript strict mode.

It is available here:\r\n\r\n> [http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/05/x64/default.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/05/x64/default.aspx)\r\n\r\nFor your quick reference (and mine :) I've jotted down the important points here if you haven't got the time or inclination to read the article. Here goes.\r\n\r\n-   Moving from 32-bit to 64-bit is *not* just a re-compile away.\r\n-   You get to address really really large chunks of memory (on the order of terabytes and even larger). Each process gets its own 8TB chunk of memory from the OS.\r\n-   All system DLLs are loaded above 4GB typically at addresses around 0x7FF00000000.\r\n-   The x64 linker assigns the default load address for 64-bit applications to just above 32 bits. This is being done so that you can quickly discover porting bugs. If you are for instance using a 32-bit pointer where you should have used a 64-bit pointer, because the base address is greater than what can be accommodated in 32 bits the pointer will effectively get truncated resulting in an access violation.\r\n-   Most Win32 datatypes continue to retain the size from the 32-bit world. INTs, LONGs, WORDs and DWORDs continue to be 32-bits wide. HANDLEs have become 64-bits wide though.\r\n-   x64 versions of Windows include a sub-system called WOW64 that allows 32-bit applications to just work on x64.\r\n-   A 64-bit application **cannot** load 32-bit DLLs and vice versa. However 64 and 32-bit applications can still talk to each other using inter-process communication mechanisms (shared memory, named pipes, synchronization objects).\r\n-   x64 is officially off limits for 16-bit applications.\r\n-   Two copies of system DLLs are maintained - one for 64-bit applications and one for 32-bit applications. WOW64 silently re-directs file I/O on the system folder for 32-bit applications to `\\Windows\\SysWow64`. If you want to figure out the path to the 32-bit system folder from a 64-bit app then you can do that by calling `GetSystemWow64Directory`.\r\n-   Just like the file system, WOW64 silently re-directs access to the registry also for 32-bit applications. This is to prevent each type of application from stepping on each other's toes, as can happen when a 64-bit app `CoCreateInstance`s a 32-bit COM component! So, a 32-bit application would see a different `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT` (and a few other keys) as opposed to a 64-bit app.\r\n-   x64 now includes a feature called *PatchGuard* which basically [BSOD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_screen_of_death)s your system if any kernel mode code alters important kernel mode data structures such as the *Interrupt Dispatch Table* (IDT). Hmm. Now there's a challenge for rootkit writers and tools such as [Regmon](http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Regmon.html) that rely on being able to mess around with the IDT.\r\n-   CPU registers are now 64-bits wide (obviously) and are called `RAX`, `RBX`, `RCX`, `RDX`, `RSI` and so forth. 8 new general purpose registers have been added and are called `R8`, `R9`, `R10` and so on till `R15`.\r\n-   No more `__cdecl`, `__stdcall`, `__fastcall` or `__thiscall`! There is only a single calling convention in x64 which passes the first 4 parameters to a function via `RCX`, `RDX`, `R8` and `R9` and the remaining parameters via the stack.\r\n\r\nA few quick points on writing code that works on 32-bit and 64-bit computers:\r\n\r\n-   Pointers *cannot* be stored in 32-bit types such as `int`s, `long`s or `DWORD`s.\r\n-   Use `DWORD_PTR`s, `INT_PTR`s and `LONG_PTR`s when you want to store pointer values. These types automatically become 64-bits wide on x64 systems (after a recompile that is).\r\n-   When you use functions like `printf` and `sprintf` do not use `%X` to print pointer values. Use `%p` and you're automagically protected.\r\n-   Inline assembly is not supported in the 64-bit C++ compiler.

There is this program that I am working on which happens to embed [Office](http://office.microsoft.com/) documents into a browser control hosted in a `CHtmlView` derived view window (that's right, we use [MFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Classes)). The requirement was to popup a little toolbar with a *save* button whenever the user did some in-place editing on whatever's displayed in the browser control. We already knew how to detect whether at a given point in time the document currently displayed in the browser has been edited. This was done in this manner (error checks omitted for brevity):\r\n\r\n    bool IsDirty()\r\n    {\r\n        //\r\n        // get hold of the html view object somehow\r\n        //\r\n        CHtmlView *pView = GetViewSomehow();\r\n\r\n        //\r\n        // get a pointer to the HTML document object\r\n        //\r\n        CComPtr<IDispatch> spDocument( pView->GetHtmlDocument() );\r\n\r\n        //\r\n        // turns out that you can QI on the doc object to\r\n        // get a \"IPersistStorage\" object which is directly linked\r\n        // to whatever happens to be embedded in the browser\r\n        //\r\n        CComPtr<IPersistStorage> spStorage;\r\n        HRESULT hr = spDocument->QueryInterface( IID_IPersistStorage, (void **)&spStorage );\r\n\r\n        //\r\n        // now we just call \"IPersistStorage::IsDirty\" to figure\r\n        // out whether the doc's been edited\r\n        //\r\n        hr = spStorage->IsDirty();\r\n        return ( hr == S_OK );\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe question of course was to figure out when this routine will be invoked so we can display the toolbar. We first came up with an approach that involved continuously polling for changes by making some creative use of `CWinApp::OnIdle`. But that resulted in short bursts of CPU usage spikes and while the solution worked, it somehow didn't *feel* right!\r\n\r\nThe next thing we tried was to see if Windows [hooks](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/hooks.asp) can be put to some use here. We quickly set up a system-wide keyboard and mouse hook which \"phoned home\" so to speak whenever an event occurred by posting a custom message to a window. Whenever this message is received by the window it would call our clever little `IsDirty` routine to check if the document has been modified and get the toolbar displayed if need be. I let out a satisfied little burp at this point and compiled, linked and hit [Ctrl+F5](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/archive/2005/09/22/F5_vs_CtrlF5.aspx).\r\n\r\nI loaded up a [PowerPoint](http://www.microsoft.com/powerpoint/) file into the browser control and pressed a few keys and whopeeee(!) the toolbar appeared straightaway. On doing some additional testing however I discovered that the damn thing showed up only with the second key press and not immediately after the first one! As it turns out, Windows delivers messages to hooks *before* they are delivered to the target application. So my hook was getting the keyboard event before PowerPoint was getting it and the call to `IsDirty` was consequently returning `false` as PowerPoint hadn't had a chance to mark the file as having been modified yet.\r\n\r\nThis thing drove us a little nuts until of course we figured a way out. I even made a newsgroup [post](http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.win32.programmer/browse_thread/thread/a27064ee86c786b5/69a72d1b421c2153?q=%22Windows+hooks+and+message+delivery%22&rnum=1#69a72d1b421c2153) on this issue (with no response by the way). The solution in the end turned out to be quite simple.\r\n\r\nWell-behaving hooks are required to call the `CallNextHookEx` function before returning from the hook routine. This is to let other hooks that are installed on the system have a go at the message. I had done a `PostMessage` to the application window *before* calling `CallNextHookEx` like so:\r\n\r\n\r\n    PostMessage( hwndNotify, WM_HOOK_NOTIFY_MOUSE, 0, 0 );\r\n    return CallNextHookEx( NULL, nCode, wParam, lParam );\r\n\r\nI made a small change to the order of invocation in this manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n    LRESULT lResult = CallNextHookEx( NULL, nCode, wParam, lParam );\r\n    PostMessage( hwndNotify, WM_HOOK_NOTIFY_MOUSE, 0, 0 );\r\n    return lResult;\r\n\r\nAnd voila! it started working! It must be pretty evident what the issue was by just looking at the change that was done.

In this case, this was just what the doctor ordered :)!\r\n\r\nCool eh?!\r\n","html":"<p>I ran into an interesting little issue at work the other day. There is this program that I am working on which happens to embed <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/\">Office</a> documents into a browser control hosted in a <code>CHtmlView</code> derived view window (that's right, we use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Classes\">MFC</a>). The requirement was to popup a little toolbar with a <em>save</em> button whenever the user did some in-place editing on whatever's displayed in the browser control. We already knew how to detect whether at a given point in time the document currently displayed in the browser has been edited. This was done in this manner (error checks omitted for brevity):</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool IsDirty()\n{\n    //\n    // get hold of the html view object somehow\n    //\n    CHtmlView *pView = GetViewSomehow();\n\n    //\n    // get a pointer to the HTML document object\n    //\n    CComPtr&lt;IDispatch&gt; spDocument( pView-&gt;GetHtmlDocument() );\n\n    //\n    // turns out that you can QI on the doc object to\n    // get a \"IPersistStorage\" object which is directly linked\n    // to whatever happens to be embedded in the browser\n    //\n    CComPtr&lt;IPersistStorage&gt; spStorage;\n    HRESULT hr = spDocument-&gt;QueryInterface( IID_IPersistStorage, (void **)&amp;spStorage );\n\n    //\n    // now we just call \"IPersistStorage::IsDirty\" to figure\n    // out whether the doc's been edited\n    //\n    hr = spStorage-&gt;IsDirty();\n    return ( hr == S_OK );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The question of course was to figure out when this routine will be invoked so we can display the toolbar. We first came up with an approach that involved continuously polling for changes by making some creative use of <code>CWinApp::OnIdle</code>. But that resulted in short bursts of CPU usage spikes and while the solution worked, it somehow didn't <em>feel</em> right!</p>\n\n<p>The next thing we tried was to see if Windows <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/hooks.asp\">hooks</a> can be put to some use here.

While I had *some* understanding of what Unicode was, there were a few things that I managed to learn anew. So, if you didn't know, here's the low down on the Unicode standard.\n\n#### First, some basic facts\n\n-   Firstly there are two parallel efforts aimed at standardizing the use of characters in computer programs! One is the [ISO 10646](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_character_set) project called the [Universal Character Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_character_set) (UCS) and the other is of course, Unicode. Around 1991 however, participants from both the projects fortunately decided that it would probably not be a good idea to have two competing standards for solving the same problem and decided to make both of their specifications compatible.\n\n-   The primary goal of the Unicode standard is the definition of a universal character set (!), i.e., a character set to replace all the other character sets. Further, it would also be able to accommodate characters from all the languages spoken/written in the world.\n\n-   It achieves this by assigning unique numbers - called **code points** - to each character. The Kannada letter \"ka\" for example has been assigned the code point 3221. What this means is that 3221 is forever the code for the Kannada letter \"ka\" all over the planet! Numbers such as this are assigned for all characters in all languages.\n\n-   Code points are always assigned from the range 0x000000 to 0x10FFFF. You'd need 21 bits to represent this information at most. Around 5% of this space (works out to about 50,000 characters) is currently in use, another 5% is in preparation, about 13% is reserved for private use and about 2% is just reserved and not to be used for representing characters. The remaining 75% (around 8,35,000 characters) is open for future use!\n\n-   Interestingly, effort is underway for assigning code points to characters from [imaginary languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_language) as well! [JRR Tolkien](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien) invented a whole slew of languages each with its own grammar and script for his epic trilogy - \"The Lord of the Rings\". Languages spoken and written by [elves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf), [dwarves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf), [hobbits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit) and [ents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent) (large walking/talking trees!) including a language called \"[Black Speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Speech)\" used by [orcs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc) and other such dark residents of [Mordor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordor)!\n\n#### Some caveats\n\n-   You might have heard that Unicode characters can be represented by 2 byte unsigned integers. Well, this is not entirely true. While it is possible to represent all the Unicode characters that exist in the world today (which represents the most frequently used set of characters) using 2 byte unsigned integers (given that only around 50,000 characters exist and an unsigned short can have a maximum value of 65,535) it is possible that code points get created whose value is greater than the maximum that can be accommodated in an unsigned short. The most commonly used characters however have been assigned numbers within the range 0x0000 to 0xFFFF (this is called the **Basic Multilingual Plane** or **BMP**).\n\n-   The closest data type in C/C++ that can be used to represent all the possible Unicode code points is a 4 byte integer. But this would also mean that 11 bits would get wasted for every character given that all the code points can be represented with just 21 bits. The size of the C/C++ `wchar_t` data-type is compiler dependent and the standard does not say anything on how big it must be.\n\n-   Even while using 2 bytes per character you'll immediately notice that using them is wasteful when you're mostly dealing with characters belonging, for example to the [ASCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) character set (all the ASCII character code assignments have been retained in Unicode for ensuring backward compatibility by the way) since the second byte would always have the value zero for all the characters.\n\n#### Encodings\n\n-   To get around this problem some clever folks invented \"encoding\" schemes such as [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) and [UTF-16](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16) that lay out how any Unicode code point from the entire spectrum can be represented using the least number of bytes. UTF-8 in particular is quite popular as it automatically ensures backward compatibility with older documents. All existing ASCII documents are already valid UTF-8 files. Here's a nifty little table that specifies how Unicode code points will be represented in the UTF-8 encoding scheme\n\n    <table>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">Unicode</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">UTF-8</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\">00000000 - 0000007F</td>\n    <td align=\"left\">0xxxxxxx</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\">00000080 - 000007FF</td>\n    <td align=\"left\">110xxxxx 10xxxxxx</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\">00000800 - 0000FFFF</td>\n    <td align=\"left\">1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\">00010000 - 001FFFFF</td>\n    <td align=\"left\">11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\">00200000 - 03FFFFFF</td>\n    <td align=\"left\">111110xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td align=\"left\">04000000 - 7FFFFFFF</td>\n    <td align=\"left\">1111110x 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx</td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n    The first column specifies the range of code points and the second column is a bitwise representation of how it will be denoted under UTF-8. Code points till 0x7F (ASCII character set) for instance will be represented using a single byte. For code points greater than 7F at least 2 bytes are needed and the number of contiguous bits set to 1 in the first byte till a zero is encountered indicates the number of bytes used to represent that code point. For example, 3 bytes are required for representing code points in the range 0x00000800 - 0x0000FFFF and this is indicated by the fact that the 3 most significant bits in the first byte is set to 1 followed by a zero bit.\n\n-   UTF-8 is a \"variable encoding\" scheme where each character in the document can correspond to a varying number of bytes. Finding the size of such a document post encoding can be somewhat tricky.\n\nMost of this information has been taken from the following great resources on this topic.\n\n> [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/\\~mgk25/unicode.html](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html)  \nThis is an FAQ on what it takes to support Unicode on Linux and has a lot of information on Unicode and UCS in general.  \n\n> [http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/codepages.html](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/codepages.html)  \nTalks about various character sets.

","html":"<p>There were some interesting <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/\">Unicode</a> related issues that cropped up recently in the project that I am working on that led to my doing a little research into what the fuss around unicode was all about. While I had <em>some</em> understanding of what Unicode was, there were a few things that I managed to learn anew. So, if you didn't know, here's the low down on the Unicode standard.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"firstsomebasicfacts\">First, some basic facts</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Firstly there are two parallel efforts aimed at standardizing the use of characters in computer programs! One is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_character_set\">ISO 10646</a> project called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_character_set\">Universal Character Set</a> (UCS) and the other is of course, Unicode. Around 1991 however, participants from both the projects fortunately decided that it would probably not be a good idea to have two competing standards for solving the same problem and decided to make both of their specifications compatible.</p></li>\n<li><p>The primary goal of the Unicode standard is the definition of a universal character set (!), i.e., a character set to replace all the other character sets. Further, it would also be able to accommodate characters from all the languages spoken/written in the world.</p></li>\n<li><p>It achieves this by assigning unique numbers - called <strong>code points</strong> - to each character. The Kannada letter \"ka\" for example has been assigned the code point 3221. What this means is that 3221 is forever the code for the Kannada letter \"ka\" all over the planet! Numbers such as this are assigned for all characters in all languages.</p></li>\n<li><p>Code points are always assigned from the range 0x000000 to 0x10FFFF. You'd need 21 bits to represent this information at most. Around 5% of this space (works out to about 50,000 characters) is currently in use, another 5% is in preparation, about 13% is reserved for private use and about 2% is just reserved and not to be used for representing characters. The remaining 75% (around 8,35,000 characters) is open for future use!</p></li>\n<li><p>Interestingly, effort is underway for assigning code points to characters from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_language\">imaginary languages</a> as well! <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien\">JRR Tolkien</a> invented a whole slew of languages each with its own grammar and script for his epic trilogy - \"The Lord of the Rings\". Languages spoken and written by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf\">elves</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf\">dwarves</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit\">hobbits</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent\">ents</a> (large walking/talking trees!) including a language called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Speech\">Black Speech</a>\" used by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc\">orcs</a> and other such dark residents of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordor\">Mordor</a>!</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"somecaveats\">Some caveats</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You might have heard that Unicode characters can be represented by 2 byte unsigned integers. Well, this is not entirely true. While it is possible to represent all the Unicode characters that exist in the world today (which represents the most frequently used set of characters) using 2 byte unsigned integers (given that only around 50,000 characters exist and an unsigned short can have a maximum value of 65,535) it is possible that code points get created whose value is greater than the maximum that can be accommodated in an unsigned short. The most commonly used characters however have been assigned numbers within the range 0x0000 to 0xFFFF (this is called the <strong>Basic Multilingual Plane</strong> or <strong>BMP</strong>).</p></li>\n<li><p>The closest data type in C/C++ that can be used to represent all the possible Unicode code points is a 4 byte integer. But this would also mean that 11 bits would get wasted for every character given that all the code points can be represented with just 21 bits.

What's going on here? The first thing one needs to understand about JavaScript is the notion of \"variable hoisting\". Regardless of where you have declared a variable, the runtime treats it as though it has been declared at the start of the scope. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    function hoist() {\r\n        try {\r\n            print(undeclaredVariable === undefined);\r\n            print(\"Yep, was able to refer to 'undeclaredVariable'.\");\r\n        }\r\n        catch(e) {\r\n            print(\"Could not use 'undeclaredVariable'.\");\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        try {\r\n            print(declaredLater === undefined);\r\n            print(\"Yep, was able to refer to 'declaredLater'.\");\r\n        }\r\n        catch(e) {\r\n            print(\"Could not use 'declaredLater'.\");\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        var declaredLater = 10;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    hoist();\r\n\r\nRunning this snippet produces the following output:\r\n\r\n    Could not use 'undeclaredVariable'.\r\n    true\r\n    Yep, was able to refer to 'declaredLater'.\r\n\r\nIn the function \"hoist\" we have declared a variable named \"declaredLater\" right at the end of the function body.  Interestingly, while we were unable to refer to an undeclared variable (evidenced by the fact that the \"print\" statement inside the first \"catch\" block got executed) we seem to have no problems referring to \"declaredLater\" even before it is actually declared. This is so because the JavaScript runtime \"hoists\" all the local variables declared in the function to the top of the function.  It is as though the function had been defined like so:\r\n\r\n    function hoist() {\r\n        var declaredLater;\r\n\r\n        // stuff here\r\n        \r\n        declaredLater = 10;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    hoist();\r\n\r\nNote that though the variable itself gets declared at the top of the function, the initialization still happens only on the line where it occurred in the original function - which explains why the statement `print(undeclaredVariable === undefined)` ends up printing `true`.\r\n\r\nNow, why did our \"scope\" function work the way it did? Turns out that in JavaScript curly braces do not introduce a variable scope. Only functions do. This means that variables declared inside of \"if\", \"for\", \"while\" etc. behave as though they have been declared at the top of the function. The aforementioned book therefore recommends moving all variable declarations to the top of the function. So, instead of doing the following:\r\n\r\n    function foo() {\r\n        var a = [1, 2, 3, 4];\r\n        if(someCondition() === true) {\r\n            var b, c, d;\r\n            // do something with b, c, d\r\n        }\r\n        for(var i = 0; i < a.length ; ++i) {\r\n            // do something with \"a\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nDo something like the following:\r\n\r\n    function foo() {\r\n        var a = [1, 2, 3, 4], b, c, d, i, len = a.length;\r\n\r\n        if(someCondition() === true) {\r\n            // do something with b, c, d\r\n        }\r\n        for(i = 0; i < len ; ++i) {\r\n            // do something with \"a\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis makes it clear that the scope of the variables in question is the function \"foo\".\r\n\r\nThe key takeaways therefore are the following:\r\n\r\n-   Code blocks do not determine variable scope in JavaScript.

The following script does a quick and dirty job of producing a file with all the numbers.\n\n     import Blender;\n     from Blender import *;\n\n     import Blender.Scene;\n     from Blender.Scene import *;\n\n     f = open( \"co.csv\", \"w\" )\n\n     scenes = Scene.Get(); # iterate thru all ze scenes\n     for sc in scenes:\n       objects = sc.getChildren(); # run thru all ze objects in this scene\n       for obj in objects:\n         if( obj.getType() != \"Mesh\" ): # we are interested only in meshes\n           continue;\n         print \"exporting \", obj.name;\n         f.write( \"# \" + obj.name + \"\\n\" ); # write the name of the object\n                                            # into the file; our renderer\n                                            # ignores lines starting with\n                                            # the '#' character\n\n         data = obj.getData(0, 1); # get co-ord data\n         for face in data.faces: # blender gives us the co-ords face-wise\n           #\n           # first we write out the normal vector for this polygon\n           #\n           f.write( \"--\" +\n                    ( '%f' % face.no.x ) + \",\" +\n                    ( '%f' % face.no.y ) + \",\" +\n                    ( '%f' % face.no.z ) + \"\\n\" );\n\n           #\n           # now, write out all the vertices\n           #\n           for v in face.verts:\n               f.write( ( '%f' % v.co.x ) + \",\" +\n                        ( '%f' % v.co.y ) + \",\" +\n                        ( '%f' % v.co.z ) + \"\\n\" )\n        \n     f.close();\n\nNothing spectacular about the script really. Here's a screenshot of how Blender's default *suzanne monkey* model looks like in my OpenGL program.\n\n> ![suzanne monkey](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/suzanne.png \"suzanne\")\n\nBut one problem I quickly ran into was with regard to the scale of the co-ordinates output by Blender. Sometimes Blender's data would cause the model to be rendered in gigantic proportions and I'd have to render it far into the screen to make it fit inside the window. What I really needed was a script that could *post-process* the co-ordinates from Blender (basically, scale them down). I figured I'll write it in Python (I could have done the scaling while exporting them from Blender of course, but where's the fun in that!) and boy was it cool, or was it cool!\n\nPython supports this super-cool feature called \"List comprehension\" that allows you to succintly express operations that you want performed on elements in a collection. In my case the file containing the list of co-ordinates looked like this:\n\n    -3.448783,-1.912737,-0.861946\n    -3.281278,-2.116843,-0.861946\n    -2.328871,-1.164436,-3.555760\n    -2.328871,-1.164436,-3.555760\n    -3.573251,-1.679874,-0.861946\n    -3.448783,-1.912737,-0.861946\n\nAnd I wanted each of those numbers scaled down by a factor. The script turned out to be remarkably short and it has elegance written all over it!\n\n     import string;\n\n     #\n     # open the source, dest files\n     #\n     src = open( \"co.csv\", \"r\" );\n     dst = open( \"cos.csv\", \"w\" );\n\n     #\n     # process each line\n     #\n     line = src.readline();\n     while( len( line ) > 0 ):\n      #\n      # process it only if it is a non-comment and non\n      # normal line\n      #\n      if( line[0] != \"#\" and line[0:2] != \"--\" ):\n       line = string.join( [ str( float( x ) * 0.25 )\n               for x in string.split( line, \",\" ) ], \",\" ) + \"\\n\";\n       dst.write( line );\n       line = src.readline();\n\n     src.close();\n     dst.close();\n\nTake special note of the highlighted line. Believe it or not, but that single line of code splits a line of comma delimited text, converts each resulting token into a float, multiplies it with 0.25, converts the value back into a string and then concatenates the list of converted values into a comma delimited string again! Now I know that some of you're thinking that we have traded off clarity of code for expressive power and that is true to an extent here. But it isn't anymore obtuse than, say a regular expression! I guess it boils down to personal preference at the end of the day.\n\nI *could* have written 20 lines to do the same thing but I sure wouldn't be feeling as pleased as I am feeling right now!

The app allows users to write text notes and tag them with specific key words. Each note will have a unique identifier which will serve as its key and apart from the note text, it will be associated with a collection of tag strings. Here's a sample note object represented in JavaScript object literal notation:\r\n\r\n    var note = {\r\n          id: 1,\r\n          text: \"Note text.\",\r\n          tags: [\"sample\", \"test\"]\r\n        };\r\n\r\nWe'll build a `NotesStore` object that has the following interface:\r\n\r\n    var NotesStore = {\r\n            init: function(callback) {\r\n            },\r\n\r\n            addNote: function(text, tags, callback) {\r\n            },\r\n        \r\n            listNotes: function(callback) {\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\nIt should be fairly self-evident as to what each method does. All method calls execute asynchronously and where a result is to be returned to the caller, the interface accepts a reference to a callback that is to be invoked with the result. Let's see what it takes to efficiently implement this object using an indexed database.\r\n\r\n### Testing for Indexed DB\r\n\r\nThe root object that you deal with when talking to the indexed DB API is called `indexedDB`. In fact you can check for the presence of this object to see whether the current browser supports indexed DB or not. Like so:\r\n\r\n    if(window[\"indexedDB\"] === undefined) {\r\n          // nope, no indexed DB!\r\n        } else {\r\n          // yep, we're good to go!\r\n        }\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use the [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/) JavaScript library to test for support for indexed DB like so:\r\n\r\n    if(Modernizr.indexeddb) {\r\n            // yep, go indexeddb!\r\n        } else {\r\n            // bleh! No joy!\r\n        }\r\n\r\n### Asynchronous requests\r\n\r\nThe asynchronous API calls work through what are known as \"request\" objects. When an asynchronous API call is made, it would return a reference to a \"request\" object which exposes two events - `onsuccess` and `onerror`. The former is raised when the API executes successfully and the latter is raised when it errors out. Here's what a typical call looks like:\r\n\r\n    var req = someAsyncCall();\r\n        req.onsuccess = function() {\r\n            // handle success case\r\n        };\r\n        req.onerror = function() {\r\n            // handle error\r\n        };\r\n\r\nAs you work with the indexedDB API you eventually get to a point where it becomes somewhat hard to keep track of all the callbacks. In a future post I'll explore some ideas I am currently playing with on how we can simplify this further. For now though, to make our exploration of the API somewhat simpler I'll define and use a small utility routine that abstracts the \"request\" pattern away:\r\n\r\n    var Utils = {\r\n            errorHandler: function(cb) {\r\n                return function(e) {\r\n                    if(cb) {\r\n                        cb(e);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        throw e;\r\n                    }\r\n                };\r\n            },\r\n        \r\n            request: function (req, callback, err_callback) {\r\n                if (callback) {\r\n                    req.onsuccess = function (e) {\r\n                        callback(e);\r\n                    };\r\n                }\r\n                req.onerror = errorHandler(err_callback);\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\nNow, I can write my async calls like so:\r\n\r\n    Utils.request(someAsyncCall(), function(e) {\r\n            // handle completion of call\r\n        });\r\n\r\n### Creating and opening the database\r\n\r\nCreating/opening a database is done by calling the `open` method of the `indexedDB` object. Here's an implementation of the `NotesStore` object's `init` method:\r\n\r\n    var NotesStore = {\r\n        name: \"notes-db\",\r\n        db: null,\r\n        ver: \"1.0\",\r\n        init: function(callback) {\r\n            var self = this;\r\n            callback = callback || function () { };\r\n            Utils.request(window.indexedDB.open(\"open\", this.name), function(e) {\r\n                self.db = e.result;\r\n                callback();\r\n            });\r\n        },\r\n\r\n        .\r\n\r\nThe `open` method opens the database if it already exists or creates a new one if not. The success callback of the request object returned by `open` receives an event object as a parameter whose `result` property is a reference to the newly opened database. You can think of this as the object that represents the connection to the database. When this object is destroyed (or if you called its `close` method) the connection to the database is terminated.\r\n\r\n### Coming up\r\n\r\nNow that we have the database created, in the next post, we'll go ahead and create the rest of the database objects.\r\n","html":"<p>In the <a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-OntheHTML5IndexedDBAPIPart1ofn.aspx\">previous post</a> in this series we covered the fundamentals of the Indexed DB specification.

In this post (and over the next post or two) we review a technology that solves an important piece of the application puzzle - that of managing storage and retrieval of user specific data on the client side, called \"Indexed DB\". For almost as long as the web has been around, there has been a need for web sites to track visitor specific information in one form or another. Using HTTP cookies has so far been pretty much the only standards based option available to web developers. While plug-in based alternatives in the form of Silverlight and Flash do exist, the typical challenges imposed on end users who either do not have the plug-in in question installed or are using the wrong version serves to complicate matters significantly. Let's first briefly review what the available alternatives are for a web developer seeking to solve the problem of managing client side storage today.\n\n#### HTTP Cookies\n\nHTTP cookies allow web applications to store small amounts of textual data on the client side using specially crafted HTTP headers. Access to this data is provided via the browser DOM. JavaScript code must be used to parse and make sense of the data. While this works, there are significant challenges in working with cookies:\n\n -   Cookies are not allowed to be greater than 4 KB in size.\n -   Cookies are transmitted with every request that the browser makes - even when it is requesting for things like images, script files or style sheets.\n -   The programming model is not straightforward in that it is basically just text and you need to write code to parse and crack data stored in cookies.\n -   Only textual data can be stored and retrieved.\n\n#### Plug-ins\n\nPlug-ins have historically been the natural (if not the only) choice for web developers who have needs that are not catered to sufficiently by cookies. Technologies such as Silverlight, Flash and Google Gears come with their own brand of local storage options. While they are a better option as compared to cookies they do however present some unique challenges of their own:\n\n-   As stated earlier, the primary issue is that user experience is less than stellar when you encounter cases where the user either does not have the plug-in in question installed or has the wrong version installed and must therefore upgrade. Often users are logged in to their computers with user accounts that do not have the required permission to install new software and hence are simply locked out of the web application or functionality completely.\n-   Web developers must familiarize themselves with the specific tool stack associated with the plug-in.\n\n#### DOM Storage\n\nDOM storage is a part of the HTML5 suite of specifications and is meant to be a replacement for HTTP cookies. This is actually a viable client side storage option. The idea is to basically provide a key/value based storage API that allows web applications to store user specific data in a persistent manner. The API is simple to use and it just works! However, there are some limitations to how it can be put to use which are to a large extent deliberate and by design:\n\n-   You can only store strings in DOM storage, i.e., both key and value must be JavaScript strings. You can however use JSON serialization to manage the storage and retrieval of objects.\n-   Data stored in DOM storage is scoped by the domain, i.e., it will not be possible for code running in one domain to access DOM storage data stored under the context of a different domain. While this is a good thing, the limitation however is that it is not possible to scope this with a greater level of granularity - say by specific URLs within a domain.\n-   There is no mechanism to iterate through all the data stored in DOM storage. You can only request the value for a specific key that you already know.\n\nWith that brief overview of the alternatives let us move on to the topic of this post - the Indexed Database API.\n\n### What is Indexed DB?\n\nAn Indexed DB is basically a persistent data store in the browser - a database on the client side. It defines an API that allows the storage and retrieval of key/value data. Like regular relational databases, it maintains indexes over the records it stores and developers use the Indexed DB JavaScript API to locate records by key or by looking up an index. Each database is scoped by \"origin\", i.e. the domain of the site that creates the database. The database is transactional and provides a means for traversing the data in a deterministic order.\n\nThe Indexed DB API includes a synchronous and an asynchronous version of pretty much all the interfaces. The asynchronous API is meant to be used from web apps when you are interacting with the database directly from the UI thread where having an API call block on an I/O operation is not acceptable. All blocking calls work asynchronously and results are reported via callbacks. The synchronous API counterparts are identical to the asynchronous versions except for the fact that there are no callbacks and results are returned directly.\n\n### A word on the status of the spec\n\nThe Indexed DB specification is currently (i.e., when this post was written) in draft status and should not be considered as being production ready. The specification itself is under active development and developers are encouraged to review it only with the objective of familiarizing themselves with an up and coming standard. Do not use it in production sites yet!\n\n### Setting your development environment up\n\nBefore we proceed with the API itself, you might want to spend some time setting up your development environment up. For Internet Explorer (IE), an experimental implementation of the specification is available for download from Microsoft's [HTML5 Labs](http://html5labs.interoperabilitybridges.com/prototypes/indexeddb/indexeddb/info) site. \"HTML5 Labs\" is an initiative from Microsoft for publishing prototype implementations of various key HTML5 specifications so that developers are able to experiment with them and provide feedback. The prototype implementation for Indexed DB works on Internet Explorer versions 8 and up and installing it is fairly straightforward.\n\n1.  Download the prototype by clicking on the link \"Download the Protoype now!\" from [here](http://html5labs.interoperabilitybridges.com/prototypes/indexeddb/indexeddb/info).\n\n2.  Unzip the downloaded file.\n\n3.  If you are running a 32-bit version of Windows then run *vcredist\\_x86.exe*.\n\n4.  Register \"sqlcejse40.dll\" by running the following command from an elevated command prompt:\n\n        regsvr32 sqlcejse40.dll\n\n    If everything goes well, then you should see a screen such as the following:\n\n    [![reg](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img11.png \"reg\")](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img10.png)\n\nAlternatively, get a recent version of *Google Chrome* or *Firefox* and you should be all set.\n\n### Coming up.\n\nNow that we have the fundamentals covered, we'll go ahead and get started with the API itself from the next post. Stay tuned!\n","html":"<p>Over the years the web has increasingly transformed from being just a repository of content to a marketplace of full-fledged functional applications.

In this post we take a look at some important Indexed DB constructs that one must be familiar with while working with the core APIs.\r\n\r\n### Object stores\r\n\r\nObject stores are the indexed DB equivalent of \"tables\" from the relational database world. All data is stored inside object stores and serves as the primary unit of storage. A database can contain multiple object stores and each store is a collection of records. Each record is a simple key/value pair. Keys must uniquely identify a particular record and can be auto-generated. The records in an object store are automatically sorted in ascending order by keys. And finally, object stores can be created and deleted only under the context of \"version change\" transactions. We'll see what a \"version change\" transaction is when we review transactions later on in this post.\r\n\r\n### Keys and Values\r\n\r\nEach record in the object store is uniquely identified by a \"key\". Keys can be arrays, strings, dates or numbers. For the purpose of comparison, arrays are considered to be greater than strings which are greater than dates which in turn are considered to be greater than numbers. Keys can be \"in-line\" keys or not. By \"in-line\" we indicate to indexed DB that the key for a particular record is actually a part of the value object itself. In our notes store sample for instance, each note object has an id property which contains the unique identifier for a particular note. This is an example of an \"in-line\" key, i.e., the key is a part of the value object.\r\n\r\nWhenever keys are \"in-line\", we must also specify a \"key path\", i.e. a string that signifies how the key value can be extracted from the value object. The key path for \"note\" objects for instance is the string \"id\" since the key can be extracted from note instances by accessing the \"id\" property. But this scheme allows for the key value to be stored at an arbitrary depth in the value object's member hierarchy. Consider the following sample value object:\r\n\r\n    var product = {\r\n      info: {\r\n        name: \"Towel\",\r\n        type: \"Indispensable hitchhiker item\",\r\n      },\r\n      identity: {\r\n        server: {\r\n          value: \"T01\"\r\n        },\r\n        client: {\r\n          value: \"TC01\"\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n      price: \"Priceless\"\r\n    };\r\n\r\nHere, the following key path might be used:\r\n\r\n    identity.client.value\r\n\r\n### Database versioning\r\n\r\nIndexed DB databases have a version string associated with them. This can be used by web applications to determine whether the database on a particular client has the latest structure or not. This is useful when you make changes to your database's data model and want to propagate those changes to existing clients who are on the previous version of your data model. You can simply change the version number for the new structure and check for it the next time the user runs your app and do the needful to upgrade the structure and migrate the data.\r\n\r\nVersion number changes must be performed under the context of a \"version change\" transaction. Before we talk about that though let's quickly review what \"transactions\" are.\r\n\r\n### Transactions\r\n\r\nLike relational databases, indexed DB also performs all of its I/O operations under the context of transactions. Transactions are created through connection objects and enable atomic, durable data access and mutation. There are two key attributes for transaction objects:\r\n\r\n1.  #### Scope\r\n\r\n    The scope determines which parts of the database can be affected through the transaction. This basically helps the indexed DB implementation determine what kind of isolation level to apply to objects during the lifetime of the transaction. You can think of the scope as simply being a list of object stores that will form a part of the transaction.\r\n\r\n2.  #### Mode\r\n\r\n    The transaction mode determines what kind of I/O operation is permitted in the transaction. The mode can be:\r\n\r\n    1.  ##### Read only\r\n\r\n        Allows only \"read\" operations on the objects that are a part of the transaction's scope.\r\n\r\n    2.  ##### Read/write\r\n\r\n        Allows \"read\" and \"write\" operations on the objects that are a part of the transaction's scope.\r\n\r\n    3.  ##### Version change\r\n\r\n        The \"version change\" mode allows \"read\" and \"write\" operations and also allows the creation and deletion of object stores and indexes, i.e., the structure of the database can be modified only under the context of a \"version change\" transaction.\r\n\r\n    Transaction objects auto-commit themselves unless they have been explicitly aborted. Transaction objects expose events to notify clients of:\r\n\r\n    -   when they complete\r\n    -   when they abort and\r\n    -   when they timeout\r\n\r\n### Creating the object store\r\n\r\nOur notes store database will contain only a single object store to record the list of notes. As discussed earlier, object stores must be created under the context of a \"version change\" transaction. Let's go ahead and extend the `init` method of the `NotesStore` object to include the creation of the object store. I've highlighted the changed bits in bold.\r\n\r\n    var NotesStore = {\r\n        name: \"notes-db\",\r\n        store_name: \"notes-store\",\r\n        store_key_path: \"id\",\r\n        db: null,\r\n        ver: \"1.0\",\r\n        init: function (callback) {\r\n            var self = this;\r\n            callback = callback || function () { };\r\n            Utils.request(window.indexedDB.open(\"open\", this.name), function (e) {\r\n                self.db = e.result;\r\n\r\n                // if the version of this db is not equal to\r\n                // self.version then change the version\r\n                if (self.db.version !== self.version) {\r\n                    Utils.request(self.db.setVersion(self.ver), function (e2) {\r\n                        var txn = e2.result;\r\n\r\n                        // create object store\r\n                        self.db.createObjectStore(self.store_name,\r\n                                                  self.store_key_path,\r\n                                                  true);\r\n                        txn.commit();\r\n                        callback();\r\n                    });\r\n                } else {\r\n                    callback();\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        },\r\n        .\r\n\r\nObject stores are created by calling the `createObjectStore` method on the database object. The first parameter is the name of the object store. This is followed by the string identifying the key path and finally a Boolean flag indicating whether the key value should be auto-generated by the database when new records are added.\r\n\r\n### Adding data to object stores\r\n\r\nNew records can be added to an object store by calling the `put` method on the object store object. A reference to the object store instance can be retrieved through the transaction object. Let's implement the `addNote` method of our `NotesStore` object and see how we can go about adding a new record:\r\n\r\n        .\r\n        addNote: function (text, tags, callback) {\r\n            var self = this;\r\n            callback = callback || function () { };\r\n            var txn = self.db.transaction(null, TransactionMode.ReadWrite);\r\n            var store = txn.objectStore(self.store_name);\r\n            Utils.request(store.put({\r\n                text: text,\r\n                tags: tags\r\n            }), function (e) {\r\n                txn.commit();\r\n                callback();\r\n            });\r\n        },\r\n\r\n        .\r\n\r\nThis method can be broken down into the following steps:\r\n\r\n1.  Invoke the `transaction` method on the database object to start off a new transaction. The first parameter is the list of names of the object stores which are going to be a part of the transaction. Passing `null` causes all the object stores in the database to be a part of the scope. The second parameter indicates the transaction mode. This is basically a numeric constant which we have declared like so:\r\n\r\n        // IndexedDB transaction mode constants\r\n        var TransactionMode = {\r\n            ReadWrite: 0,\r\n            ReadOnly: 1,\r\n            VersionChange: 2\r\n        };\r\n\r\n2.  Once the transaction has been created we acquire a reference to the object store in question through the transaction object's `objectStore` method.\r\n\r\n3.  Once we have the object store handy, adding a new record is just a matter of issuing an asynchronous API call to the object store's `put` method passing in the new object to be added to the store. Note that we do not pass a value for the `id` field of the new note object. Since we passed `true` for the auto-generate parameter while creating the object store, the indexed DB implementation should take care of automatically assigning a unique identifier for the new record.\r\n\r\n4.  Once the asynchronous `put` call completes successfully, we commit the transaction.\r\n\r\n### Coming up\r\n\r\nIn the next post, we'll take a look at retrieving records from an indexed DB. Surprisingly, this turns out to be slightly trickier than what one might expect.\r\n","html":"<p>In the <a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-OntheHTML5IndexedDBAPIPart2ofn.aspx\">previous post</a> we covered some more background on working with the Indexed DB API and briefly reviewed the mechanics of creating a new database.

Transaction objects expose events to notify clients of:</p>\n\n<ul><li>when they complete</li>\n<li>when they abort and</li>\n<li>when they timeout</li></ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"creatingtheobjectstore\">Creating the object store</h3>\n\n<p>Our notes store database will contain only a single object store to record the list of notes. As discussed earlier, object stores must be created under the context of a \"version change\" transaction. Let's go ahead and extend the <code>init</code> method of the <code>NotesStore</code> object to include the creation of the object store. I've highlighted the changed bits in bold.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var NotesStore = {\n    name: \"notes-db\",\n    store_name: \"notes-store\",\n    store_key_path: \"id\",\n    db: null,\n    ver: \"1.0\",\n    init: function (callback) {\n        var self = this;\n        callback = callback || function () { };\n        Utils.request(window.indexedDB.open(\"open\", this.name), function (e) {\n            self.db = e.result;\n\n            // if the version of this db is not equal to\n            // self.version then change the version\n            if (self.db.version !== self.version) {\n                Utils.request(self.db.setVersion(self.ver), function (e2) {\n                    var txn = e2.result;\n\n                    // create object store\n                    self.db.createObjectStore(self.store_name,\n                                              self.store_key_path,\n                                              true);\n                    txn.commit();\n                    callback();\n                });\n            } else {\n                callback();\n            }\n        });\n    },\n    .\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Object stores are created by calling the <code>createObjectStore</code> method on the database object. The first parameter is the name of the object store. This is followed by the string identifying the key path and finally a Boolean flag indicating whether the key value should be auto-generated by the database when new records are added.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"addingdatatoobjectstores\">Adding data to object stores</h3>\n\n<p>New records can be added to an object store by calling the <code>put</code> method on the object store object. A reference to the object store instance can be retrieved through the transaction object. Let's implement the <code>addNote</code> method of our <code>NotesStore</code> object and see how we can go about adding a new record:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    .\n    addNote: function (text, tags, callback) {\n        var self = this;\n        callback = callback || function () { };\n        var txn = self.db.transaction(null, TransactionMode.ReadWrite);\n        var store = txn.objectStore(self.store_name);\n        Utils.request(store.put({\n            text: text,\n            tags: tags\n        }), function (e) {\n            txn.commit();\n            callback();\n        });\n    },\n\n    .\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This method can be broken down into the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Invoke the <code>transaction</code> method on the database object to start off a new transaction. The first parameter is the list of names of the object stores which are going to be a part of the transaction. Passing <code>null</code> causes all the object stores in the database to be a part of the scope. The second parameter indicates the transaction mode. This is basically a numeric constant which we have declared like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// IndexedDB transaction mode constants\nvar TransactionMode = {\n    ReadWrite: 0,\n    ReadOnly: 1,\n    VersionChange: 2\n};\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Once the transaction has been created we acquire a reference to the object store in question through the transaction object's <code>objectStore</code> method.</p></li>\n<li><p>Once we have the object store handy, adding a new record is just a matter of issuing an asynchronous API call to the object store's <code>put</code> method passing in the new object to be added to the store. Note that we do not pass a value for the <code>id</code> field of the new note object. Since we passed <code>true</code> for the auto-generate parameter while creating the object store, the indexed DB implementation should take care of automatically assigning a unique identifier for the new record.</p></li>\n<li><p>Once the asynchronous <code>put</code> call completes successfully, we commit the transaction.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"comingup\">Coming up</h3>\n\n<p>In the next post, we'll take a look at retrieving records from an indexed DB.

The basic issue is of course that while the module is being executed the operating system has the file locked. So something like this will just not work:\n\n        TCHAR szModule[MAX_PATH];\n        GetModuleFileName( NULL, szModule, MAX_PATH );\n        DeleteFile( szModule );\n\nOf the various options available, the author of the said article had suggested the following approach as being the definitive one as it has the added benefit of functioning correctly on all versions of Microsoft Windows (starting with '95).\n\nNow would be a good time to hop over to the article and see what it's about (and while you're there make sure you look at some of the other articles - pretty neat). Here's the link:\n\n> [http://www.catch22.net/tuts/self-deleting-executables](http://www.catch22.net/tuts/self-deleting-executables)\n\nAnd here's the approach in brief:\n\n-   When it's time to delete ourselves we first spawn an external process that is guaranteed to exist on all Windows computers (*explorer.exe* for example) in the suspended state. We do this by calling `CreateProcess` passing `CREATE_SUSPENDED` for the `dwCreationFlags` parameter. Note that when a process is launched this way there's really no telling at what point the primary thread of the process will get suspended. But it does appear to get suspended long before the entry point gets invoked and in fact it occurs even before the Win32 environment for the process has been fully initialized.\n\n-   After this we get the `CONTEXT` data (basically, the CPU register state) for the suspended primary thread (in the remote process) via `GetThreadContext`.\n\n-   We then manipulate the stack pointer (`ESP`) to allocate some space on the remote stack for storing some of our data (like the path to the executable to be deleted). After this we plonk the binary code for a local routine that we've written for deleting files over to the remote process (along with the data it needs) by calling `WriteProcessMemory`.\n\n-   Next we mess around with the instruction pointer (`EIP`) so that it points to the binary code we've copied to the remote process and update the suspended thread's context (via `SetThreadContext`).\n\n-   And finally, we resume execution of the remote process (via `ResumeThread`). Since the `EIP` in the remote thread is now pointing to our code, it executes it; which of course, happily deletes the original executable. And that's it!\n\nWhile this approach does get the job done, the fact that our deletion code executes in the remote process even before Windows has had a chance to initialize it fully places some restrictions on the kind of APIs that we can invoke. It so turns out that APIs like `DeleteFile` and `ExitProcess` do work while the process is in this half-baked state. So I figured I'll modify the approach somewhat so that it allows us to call any API we want from our injected code. Here's what I did:\n\n-   As before we launch the external process in a suspended state. However, instead of plonking our code at the location that `ESP` happens to be pointing at when it got suspended, we put it over the executable's entry-point routine, i.e., we replace the remote process's entry point with our own injected code. And when the entry-point code executes we can be pretty sure that the Win32 environment is fully initialized and primed for use!\n\n-   Figuring out where the entry point of a module lives requires us to parse PE file format structures. In your own program for example, the following code would give you a pointer to the entry point routine in the process's executable image:\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    #pragma pack( push, 1 )\n\n    struct coff_header\n    {\n        unsigned short machine;\n        unsigned short sections;\n        unsigned int timestamp;\n        unsigned int symboltable;\n        unsigned int symbols;\n        unsigned short size_of_opt_header;\n        unsigned short characteristics;\n    };\n\n    struct optional_header\n    {\n        unsigned short magic;\n        char linker_version_major;\n        char linker_version_minor;\n        unsigned int code_size;\n        unsigned int idata_size;\n        unsigned int udata_size;\n        unsigned int entry_point;\n        unsigned int code_base;\n    };\n\n    #pragma pack( pop )\n\n    //\n    // get the module address\n    //\n    char *module = (char *)GetModuleHandle( NULL );\n\n    //\n    // get the sig\n    //\n    int *offset = (int*)( module + 0x3c );\n    char *sig = module + *offset;\n\n    //\n    // get the coff header\n    //\n    coff_header *coff = (coff_header *)( sig + 4 );\n\n    //\n    // get the optional header\n    //\n    optional_header *opt = (optional_header *)( (char *)coff +\n       sizeof( coff_header ) );\n\n    //\n    // get the entry point\n    //\n    char *entry_point = (char *)module + opt->entry_point;\n\n-   The entry point that *you* define by the way - `main` or `WinMain -` isn't the actual entry point routine. The compiler inserts its own entry point which in turn calls our function. This entry point typically does stuff like CRT initialization and cleanup. In an ANSI console app for instance the actual entry point routine is something called `mainCRTStartup`.\n\n-   It appears logical that we should be able to find the entry point routine in remote processes also in a similar fashion using `ReadProcessMemory`. While that is so, finding the equivalent of the `module` variable in the code given above for remote processes turned out to be trickier than anticipated. The problem is that there is no convenient `GetModuleHandle` routine that'll work for remote processes.\n\n-   As it turns out `GetModuleHandle` returns a virtual address that is valid only within the relevant process's address space. `ReadProcessMemory` however requires *real* addresses to work with. So the question is, how do we get to know the remote process's base address in memory? The solution as it turned out requires us to dig deep into the OS's internals! The credit for this solution goes to *Ashkbiz Danehkar* whose article called [Injective Code inside Import Table](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/inject2it.asp) on [Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/) outlines a method for finding this.\n\n-   In brief, the operating system maintains a user-mode data structure for every thread in the system called the *Thread Environment Block* (TEB) which describes pretty much everything you'd want to know about the thread including a pointer to another data structure called the *Process Environment Block* (PEB) which, as may be apparent describes processes including, happily for us, a pointer to the image's base address in memory! These structures are not however documented (by Microsoft that is ;). But some very very clever folks at [http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/](http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/) managed to figure out the layout for these structures all by themselves!\n\n-   So all we need to do is:\n\n    -   Figure out where the TEB for the primary thread lives in the remote process. This information is stored in the thread's FS register which is accessible via the `GetThreadSelectorEntry` API.\n    -   Read the PEB using the pointer to it in the thread's TEB via `ReadProcessMemory`.\n    -   Use the pointer to the image's base address in the PEB and parse the PE structures till we are left with a reference to the remote process's entry point routine.\n    -   Phew!\n\n    Here's the code that achieves this:\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    //\n    // Gets the address of the entry point routine given a\n    // handle to a process and its primary thread.\n    //\n    DWORD GetProcessEntryPointAddress( HANDLE hProcess, HANDLE hThread )\n    {\n        CONTEXT             context;\n        LDT_ENTRY           entry;\n        TEB                 teb;\n        PEB                 peb;\n        DWORD               read;\n        DWORD               dwFSBase;\n        DWORD               dwImageBase, dwOffset;\n        DWORD               dwOptHeaderOffset;\n        optional_header     opt;\n        \n        //\n        // get the current thread context\n        //\n        context.ContextFlags = CONTEXT_FULL | CONTEXT_DEBUG_REGISTERS;\n        GetThreadContext( hThread, &context );\n        \n        //\n        // use the segment register value to get a pointer to\n        // the TEB\n        //\n        GetThreadSelectorEntry( hThread, context.SegFs, &entry );\n        dwFSBase = ( entry.HighWord.Bits.BaseHi << 24 ) |\n                         ( entry.HighWord.Bits.BaseMid << 16 ) |\n                         ( entry.BaseLow );\n        \n        //\n        // read the teb\n        //\n        ReadProcessMemory( hProcess, (LPCVOID)dwFSBase,\n                           &teb, sizeof( TEB ), &read );\n        \n        //\n        // read the peb from the location pointed at by the teb\n        //\n        ReadProcessMemory( hProcess, (LPCVOID)teb.Peb,\n                           &peb, sizeof( PEB ), &read );\n        \n        //\n        // figure out where the entry point is located;\n        //\n        dwImageBase = (DWORD)peb.ImageBaseAddress;\n        ReadProcessMemory( hProcess, (LPCVOID)( dwImageBase + 0x3c ),\n                           &dwOffset, sizeof( DWORD ), &read );\n        \n        dwOptHeaderOffset = ( dwImageBase + dwOffset + 4 +\n                                sizeof( coff_header ) );\n        ReadProcessMemory( hProcess, (LPCVOID)dwOptHeaderOffset,\n                           &opt, sizeof( optional_header ), &read );\n        \n        return ( dwImageBase + opt.entry_point );\n    }\n\n-   If you're wondering what the weird code initializing `dwFSBase` means all I can do is direct you to the documentation for the `LDT_ENTRY` data structure in MSDN. Structures of this kind are partly the reason why system programmers tend to go bald early in life.\n\n-   Now that we know where the entry point lives in the remote process it should be really straightforward right? Wrong! There still is that itsy bitsy problem of figuring out how we are to pass data to the remote process!\n\n    The routine that deletes our executable looks like this:\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    #pragma pack(push, 1)\n\n    //\n    //  Structure to inject into remote process. Contains \n    //  function pointers and code to execute.\n    //\n    typedef struct _SELFDEL\n    {\n        HANDLE  hParent;                // parent process handle\n        FARPROC fnWaitForSingleObject;\n        FARPROC fnCloseHandle;\n        FARPROC fnDeleteFile;\n        FARPROC fnSleep;\n        FARPROC fnExitProcess;\n        FARPROC fnRemoveDirectory;\n        FARPROC fnGetLastError;\n        FARPROC fnLoadLibrary;\n        FARPROC fnGetProcAddress;\n        BOOL    fRemDir;\n        TCHAR   szFileName[MAX_PATH];   // file to delete\n    } SELFDEL;\n\n    #pragma pack(pop)\n\n    //\n    //  Routine to execute in remote process. \n    //\n    static void remote_thread(SELFDEL *remote)\n    {\n        // wait for parent process to terminate\n        remote->fnWaitForSingleObject(remote->hParent, INFINITE);\n        remote->fnCloseHandle(remote->hParent);\n\n        // try to delete the executable file \n        while(!remote->fnDeleteFile(remote->szFileName))\n        {\n            // failed - try again in one second's time\n            remote->fnSleep(1000);\n        }\n\n        // finished! exit so that we don't execute garbage code\n        remote->fnExitProcess(0);\n    }\n\n-   As you might have noticed the function `remote_thread` makes all system calls via function pointers instead of calling them directly. This is done because, in the normal course, the compiler generates tiny stubs whenever calls to routines in dynamically loaded DLLs are made from a program. This stub jumps to a function pointer stored in a table initialized by the operating system's loader at runtime. Since we don't want these fancy stubs generated for code that is meant to be injected into a remote process, we deal exclusively with function pointers.\n\n    Fortunately for us, the system APIs (in kernel32, user32 etc.) always get loaded at the same virtual address in all processes. So all we need to do is initialize a data structure with pointers to all the system calls we want to make from the remote process and pass this structure along also. With our entry-point overwrite strategy of course, how are we to do this? To make a long story short, I settled for the following approach.\n\n-   First, I modified `remote_thread` to look like this:\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    //\n    //  Routine to execute in remote process. \n    //\n    static void remote_thread()\n    {\n        //\n        // this will get replaced with a\n        // real pointer to the data when it\n        // gets injected into the remote\n        // process\n        //\n        SELFDEL *remote = (SELFDEL *)0xFFFFFFFF;\n\n        //\n        // wait for parent process to terminate\n        //\n        remote->fnWaitForSingleObject(remote->hParent, INFINITE);\n        remote->fnCloseHandle(remote->hParent);\n\n        //\n        // try to delete the executable file \n        //\n        while(!remote->fnDeleteFile(remote->szFileName))\n        {\n            //\n            // failed - try again in one second's time\n            //\n            remote->fnSleep(1000);\n        }\n\n        //\n        // finished! exit so that we don't execute garbage code\n        //\n        remote->fnExitProcess(0);\n    }\n\n-   I then converted this into shellcode (the exact mechanics of which I'll outline in another post) to arrive at what looks like this (this is just representative shellcode and not the one that got generated for the routine shown above):\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    char shellcode[] = {\n        '\\x55', '\\x8B', '\\xEC', '\\x83', '\\xEC', \n        '\\x10', '\\x53', '\\xC7', '\\x45', '\\xF0',\n        '\\xFF', '\\xFF', '\\xFF', '\\xFF',   // replace these 4 bytes\n                                          // with actual address\n        '\\x8B', '\\x45', '\\xF0', '\\x8B', '\\x48',\n        '\\x20', '\\x89', '\\x4D', '\\xF4', '\\x8B',\n        '\\x55', '\\xF0', '\\x8B', '\\x42', '\\x24',\n        '\\x89', '\\x45', '\\xFC', '\\x6A', '\\xFF', ... more shell code here\n\n-   *shellcode*, if you didn't know, is the technical term used (in security circles) to refer to binary machine code that is typically used in exploits as the payload. As it turns out in our case the value `0xFFFFFFFF` that we initialized the pointer `remote` with in `remote_thread` shows up the exact same way in the shellcode also. Since we know where the entry point lives in the remote process, all we need to do is to first replace `0xFFFFFFFF` in the shellcode with the actual pointer to the data before over-writing the entry point.

The basic issue is of course that while the module is being executed the operating system has the file locked. So something like this will just not work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    TCHAR szModule[MAX_PATH];\n    GetModuleFileName( NULL, szModule, MAX_PATH );\n    DeleteFile( szModule );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of the various options available, the author of the said article had suggested the following approach as being the definitive one as it has the added benefit of functioning correctly on all versions of Microsoft Windows (starting with '95).</p>\n\n<p>Now would be a good time to hop over to the article and see what it's about (and while you're there make sure you look at some of the other articles - pretty neat). Here's the link:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.catch22.net/tuts/self-deleting-executables\">http://www.catch22.net/tuts/self-deleting-executables</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And here's the approach in brief:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>When it's time to delete ourselves we first spawn an external process that is guaranteed to exist on all Windows computers (<em>explorer.exe</em> for example) in the suspended state. We do this by calling <code>CreateProcess</code> passing <code>CREATE_SUSPENDED</code> for the <code>dwCreationFlags</code> parameter. Note that when a process is launched this way there's really no telling at what point the primary thread of the process will get suspended. But it does appear to get suspended long before the entry point gets invoked and in fact it occurs even before the Win32 environment for the process has been fully initialized.</p></li>\n<li><p>After this we get the <code>CONTEXT</code> data (basically, the CPU register state) for the suspended primary thread (in the remote process) via <code>GetThreadContext</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>We then manipulate the stack pointer (<code>ESP</code>) to allocate some space on the remote stack for storing some of our data (like the path to the executable to be deleted). After this we plonk the binary code for a local routine that we've written for deleting files over to the remote process (along with the data it needs) by calling <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Next we mess around with the instruction pointer (<code>EIP</code>) so that it points to the binary code we've copied to the remote process and update the suspended thread's context (via <code>SetThreadContext</code>).</p></li>\n<li><p>And finally, we resume execution of the remote process (via <code>ResumeThread</code>). Since the <code>EIP</code> in the remote thread is now pointing to our code, it executes it; which of course, happily deletes the original executable. And that's it!</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While this approach does get the job done, the fact that our deletion code executes in the remote process even before Windows has had a chance to initialize it fully places some restrictions on the kind of APIs that we can invoke. It so turns out that APIs like <code>DeleteFile</code> and <code>ExitProcess</code> do work while the process is in this half-baked state. So I figured I'll modify the approach somewhat so that it allows us to call any API we want from our injected code. Here's what I did:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>As before we launch the external process in a suspended state. However, instead of plonking our code at the location that <code>ESP</code> happens to be pointing at when it got suspended, we put it over the executable's entry-point routine, i.e., we replace the remote process's entry point with our own injected code. And when the entry-point code executes we can be pretty sure that the Win32 environment is fully initialized and primed for use!</p></li>\n<li><p>Figuring out where the entry point of a module lives requires us to parse PE file format structures. In your own program for example, the following code would give you a pointer to the entry point routine in the process's executable image:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- -->\n\n<pre><code>#pragma pack( push, 1 )\n\nstruct coff_header\n{\n    unsigned short machine;\n    unsigned short sections;\n    unsigned int timestamp;\n    unsigned int symboltable;\n    unsigned int symbols;\n    unsigned short size_of_opt_header;\n    unsigned short characteristics;\n};\n\nstruct optional_header\n{\n    unsigned short magic;\n    char linker_version_major;\n    char linker_version_minor;\n    unsigned int code_size;\n    unsigned int idata_size;\n    unsigned int udata_size;\n    unsigned int entry_point;\n    unsigned int code_base;\n};\n\n#pragma pack( pop )\n\n//\n// get the module address\n//\nchar *module = (char *)GetModuleHandle( NULL );\n\n//\n// get the sig\n//\nint *offset = (int*)( module + 0x3c );\nchar *sig = module + *offset;\n\n//\n// get the coff header\n//\ncoff_header *coff = (coff_header *)( sig + 4 );\n\n//\n// get the optional header\n//\noptional_header *opt = (optional_header *)( (char *)coff +\n   sizeof( coff_header ) );\n\n//\n// get the entry point\n//\nchar *entry_point = (char *)module + opt-&gt;entry_point;\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The entry point that <em>you</em> define by the way - <code>main</code> or <code>WinMain -</code> isn't the actual entry point routine. The compiler inserts its own entry point which in turn calls our function. This entry point typically does stuff like CRT initialization and cleanup. In an ANSI console app for instance the actual entry point routine is something called <code>mainCRTStartup</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>It appears logical that we should be able to find the entry point routine in remote processes also in a similar fashion using <code>ReadProcessMemory</code>. While that is so, finding the equivalent of the <code>module</code> variable in the code given above for remote processes turned out to be trickier than anticipated. The problem is that there is no convenient <code>GetModuleHandle</code> routine that'll work for remote processes.</p></li>\n<li><p>As it turns out <code>GetModuleHandle</code> returns a virtual address that is valid only within the relevant process's address space. <code>ReadProcessMemory</code> however requires <em>real</em> addresses to work with. So the question is, how do we get to know the remote process's base address in memory? The solution as it turned out requires us to dig deep into the OS's internals! The credit for this solution goes to <em>Ashkbiz Danehkar</em> whose article called <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/inject2it.asp\">Injective Code inside Import Table</a> on <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/\">Code Project</a> outlines a method for finding this.</p></li>\n<li><p>In brief, the operating system maintains a user-mode data structure for every thread in the system called the <em>Thread Environment Block</em> (TEB) which describes pretty much everything you'd want to know about the thread including a pointer to another data structure called the <em>Process Environment Block</em> (PEB) which, as may be apparent describes processes including, happily for us, a pointer to the image's base address in memory! These structures are not however documented (by Microsoft that is ;). But some very very clever folks at <a href=\"http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/\">http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/</a> managed to figure out the layout for these structures all by themselves!</p></li>\n<li><p>So all we need to do is:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Figure out where the TEB for the primary thread lives in the remote process. This information is stored in the thread's FS register which is accessible via the <code>GetThreadSelectorEntry</code> API.</li>\n<li>Read the PEB using the pointer to it in the thread's TEB via <code>ReadProcessMemory</code>.</li>\n<li>Use the pointer to the image's base address in the PEB and parse the PE structures till we are left with a reference to the remote process's entry point routine.</li>\n<li>Phew!</li></ul>\n\n<p>Here's the code that achieves this:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- -->\n\n<pre><code>//\n// Gets the address of the entry point routine given a\n// handle to a process and its primary thread.\n//\nDWORD GetProcessEntryPointAddress( HANDLE hProcess, HANDLE hThread )\n{\n    CONTEXT             context;\n    LDT_ENTRY           entry;\n    TEB                 teb;\n    PEB                 peb;\n    DWORD               read;\n    DWORD               dwFSBase;\n    DWORD               dwImageBase, dwOffset;\n    DWORD               dwOptHeaderOffset;\n    optional_header     opt;\n\n    //\n    // get the current thread context\n    //\n    context.ContextFlags = CONTEXT_FULL | CONTEXT_DEBUG_REGISTERS;\n    GetThreadContext( hThread, &amp;context );\n\n    //\n    // use the segment register value to get a pointer to\n    // the TEB\n    //\n    GetThreadSelectorEntry( hThread, context.SegFs, &amp;entry );\n    dwFSBase = ( entry.HighWord.Bits.BaseHi &lt;&lt; 24 ) |\n                     ( entry.HighWord.Bits.BaseMid &lt;&lt; 16 ) |\n                     ( entry.BaseLow );\n\n    //\n    // read the teb\n    //\n    ReadProcessMemory( hProcess, (LPCVOID)dwFSBase,\n                       &amp;teb, sizeof( TEB ), &amp;read );\n\n    //\n    // read the peb from the location pointed at by the teb\n    //\n    ReadProcessMemory( hProcess, (LPCVOID)teb.Peb,\n                       &amp;peb, sizeof( PEB ), &amp;read );\n\n    //\n    // figure out where the entry point is located;\n    //\n    dwImageBase = (DWORD)peb.ImageBaseAddress;\n    ReadProcessMemory( hProcess, (LPCVOID)( dwImageBase + 0x3c ),\n                       &amp;dwOffset, sizeof( DWORD ), &amp;read );\n\n    dwOptHeaderOffset = ( dwImageBase + dwOffset + 4 +\n                            sizeof( coff_header ) );\n    ReadProcessMemory( hProcess, (LPCVOID)dwOptHeaderOffset,\n                       &amp;opt, sizeof( optional_header ), &amp;read );\n\n    return ( dwImageBase + opt.entry_point );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you're wondering what the weird code initializing <code>dwFSBase</code> means all I can do is direct you to the documentation for the <code>LDT_ENTRY</code> data structure in MSDN. Structures of this kind are partly the reason why system programmers tend to go bald early in life.</p></li>\n<li><p>Now that we know where the entry point lives in the remote process it should be really straightforward right? Wrong! There still is that itsy bitsy problem of figuring out how we are to pass data to the remote process!</p>\n\n<p>The routine that deletes our executable looks like this:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- -->\n\n<pre><code>#pragma pack(push, 1)\n\n//\n//  Structure to inject into remote process.

This is done because, in the normal course, the compiler generates tiny stubs whenever calls to routines in dynamically loaded DLLs are made from a program. This stub jumps to a function pointer stored in a table initialized by the operating system's loader at runtime. Since we don't want these fancy stubs generated for code that is meant to be injected into a remote process, we deal exclusively with function pointers.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately for us, the system APIs (in kernel32, user32 etc.) always get loaded at the same virtual address in all processes. So all we need to do is initialize a data structure with pointers to all the system calls we want to make from the remote process and pass this structure along also. With our entry-point overwrite strategy of course, how are we to do this? To make a long story short, I settled for the following approach.</p></li>\n<li><p>First, I modified <code>remote_thread</code> to look like this:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- -->\n\n<pre><code>//\n//  Routine to execute in remote process. \n//\nstatic void remote_thread()\n{\n    //\n    // this will get replaced with a\n    // real pointer to the data when it\n    // gets injected into the remote\n    // process\n    //\n    SELFDEL *remote = (SELFDEL *)0xFFFFFFFF;\n\n    //\n    // wait for parent process to terminate\n    //\n    remote-&gt;fnWaitForSingleObject(remote-&gt;hParent, INFINITE);\n    remote-&gt;fnCloseHandle(remote-&gt;hParent);\n\n    //\n    // try to delete the executable file \n    //\n    while(!remote-&gt;fnDeleteFile(remote-&gt;szFileName))\n    {\n        //\n        // failed - try again in one second's time\n        //\n        remote-&gt;fnSleep(1000);\n    }\n\n    //\n    // finished! exit so that we don't execute garbage code\n    //\n    remote-&gt;fnExitProcess(0);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I then converted this into shellcode (the exact mechanics of which I'll outline in another post) to arrive at what looks like this (this is just representative shellcode and not the one that got generated for the routine shown above):</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- -->\n\n<pre><code>char shellcode[] = {\n    '\\x55', '\\x8B', '\\xEC', '\\x83', '\\xEC', \n    '\\x10', '\\x53', '\\xC7', '\\x45', '\\xF0',\n    '\\xFF', '\\xFF', '\\xFF', '\\xFF',   // replace these 4 bytes\n                                      // with actual address\n    '\\x8B', '\\x45', '\\xF0', '\\x8B', '\\x48',\n    '\\x20', '\\x89', '\\x4D', '\\xF4', '\\x8B',\n    '\\x55', '\\xF0', '\\x8B', '\\x42', '\\x24',\n    '\\x89', '\\x45', '\\xFC', '\\x6A', '\\xFF', ... more shell code here\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>shellcode</em>, if you didn't know, is the technical term used (in security circles) to refer to binary machine code that is typically used in exploits as the payload. As it turns out in our case the value <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code> that we initialized the pointer <code>remote</code> with in <code>remote_thread</code> shows up the exact same way in the shellcode also.

For example, say you have this fairly useless function:\r\n\r\n    function add(a, b) {\r\n        return a + b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nLet's say that for some reason we need a version of \"`add`\" that will always have the value 5 for the parameter \"`a`\". One way we might do it is like so:\r\n\r\n    function add5(b) {\r\n        return add(5, b);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNo black magic there. I was wondering if there might be some way that we can automate the process of generating functions with part of their arguments pre-bound. Here's what I came up with:\r\n\r\n    function partialBind(f, context) {\r\n        // arguments length MUST be greater than 2\r\n        if(arguments.length <= 2) {\r\n            // coz. what're you \"partial binding\" otherwise?!\r\n            return null;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // convert args to array excluding param \"f\" and \"context\"\r\n        var arrayProto = Array.prototype;\r\n        var params = arrayProto.slice.call(arguments, 2, arguments.length);\r\n        return function () {\r\n            // append params passed to this function to \"params\"\r\n            var args = params.slice(0, params.length);\r\n            if (arguments.length > 0) {\r\n                arrayProto.forEach.call(arguments, function (p) {\r\n                    args.push(p);\r\n                });\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // call the original function\r\n            return f.apply(context, args);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis function allows me to transform pretty much any function that takes at least 1 argument into a new function that takes a subset of the arguments. Transforming our \"`add`\" function into a single parameter version with \"`a`\" bound to 5 for instance, would now look like this:\r\n\r\n    var add5 = partialBind(add, null, 5);\r\n    var val = add5(10);\r\n    assert(val === 15);\r\n\r\nInterestingly, \"`partialBind`\" allows us to compose argument binding to multiple levels. If we wanted to take our \"`add5`\" function and create another version that binds the second parameter to, say 20, then we can do this:\r\n\r\n    var add5_20 = partialBind(add5, null, 20);\r\n    var val = add5_20();\r\n    assert(val === 25);\r\n\r\nNote that we are doing a partial bind of a function that is already a partial bind of another function. Turns out we can take this to as many levels as we want. The example given above is of course somewhat concocted because we could have achieved the same result with a single partial bind instead of doing it in two levels:\r\n\r\n    var add5_20 = partialBind(add, null, 5, 20);\r\n    var val = add5_20();\r\n    assert(val === 25);\r\n\r\nAll of this works because JavaScript supports [closures](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-JavaScriptclosuresactlikeimpli.aspx).

The general guideline is to, well, not do it! Using WinJS it is possible to organize your own classes and functions into well-defined namespaces. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    (function () {\r\n        'use strict';\r\n\r\n        // export this \"enum\"\r\n        var ShapeType = Object.freeze({\r\n            None: 0,\r\n            Line: 1,\r\n            Ellipse: 2,\r\n            Rectangle: 3,\r\n            Arc: 4,\r\n            Bezier: 5\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        WinJS.Namespace.define(\"Acme.Shapes\", {\r\n            ShapeType: ShapeType\r\n        });\r\n\r\n    })();\r\n\r\nWhat this does is to basically create only one new symbol in the global namespace called \"Acme\". All the remaining objects are child properties of this root object - essentially acting like a namespace. The above given code snippet for instance will enable you to access the **ShapeType** enumeration from pretty much everywhere else like so:\r\n\r\n    var type = Acme.Shapes.ShapeType.Arc;\r\n\r\nYou can see how easy it is to extend this to define pretty much your entire project - grouping all your code under a single root namespace. We'll see further examples of how namespaces can be used as we talk about other capabilities that WinJS brings to the table.\r\n\r\n#### Classes\r\n\r\nWhile JavaScript itself is a weakly typed language it is possible to pretend like it isn't and create and use \"classes\". With WinJS you define a class by calling [WinJS.Class.define](http://bit.ly/rKtESn). This method accepts 3 parameters: a constructor function, a JavaScript object defining the instance members and another JavaScript object defining the static members. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    (function () {\r\n        \"use strict\";\r\n\r\n        // constructor function\r\n        function initShape(type) {\r\n            this.id = Acme.Shapes.Shape.newId(); // calling a static member\r\n            if (type) {\r\n                this.type = type;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        var instanceMembers = {\r\n            id: null,\r\n            type: Acme.Shapes.ShapeType.None,\r\n            draw: function () {\r\n                console.log(\"Shape.draw\");\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        var staticMembers = {\r\n            // private member\r\n            _counter: 0,\r\n            newId: function () {\r\n                return Acme.Shapes.Shape._counter++;\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        var Shape = WinJS.Class.define(initShape, instanceMembers, staticMembers);\r\n\r\n        // add to namespace\r\n        WinJS.Namespace.define(\"Acme.Shapes\", {\r\n            Shape: Shape\r\n        });\r\n    })();\r\n\r\nNow you can create and use instances of Shape like so:\r\n\r\n    var s = new Acme.Shapes.Shape(); \r\n    s.draw();\r\n\r\nThe first parameter to [WinJS.Class.define](http://bit.ly/rKtESn) is a constructor function. This gets invoked whenever a new instance is created and is the place where you write your object initialization code. The second parameter is an object that describes the runtime shape of the object, i.e. what instance members it will contain. The third parameter defines the set of static members that you can access directly from the class without creating an instance. In the snippet above you'll note that we invoke the static method **newId** from **Shape**'s constructor.\r\n\r\nFinally, you can have static and instance non-enumerable members by prefixing the name with an underscore character. This has the effect of the member not being available when you reflect on the object and try to access its members. In the example above the static member **\\_counter**is not intended to be accessed directly by client code. We express this by prefixing an underscore character and WinJS makes sure that it sets the *enumerable* property descriptor to **false** when it creates the property. When we call [Object.keys](http://bit.ly/slawwN) for instance, on the **Shape** constructor, here's what we get:\r\n\r\n    console.log(Object.keys(Acme.Shapes.Shape));\r\n    // prints \"newId\"\r\n\r\nAs you can see it does not indicate **\\_counter** as being a member of **Shape**. Having said that if you do go ahead and access **\\_counter** anyway, it'll still work! If you want a member to be really inaccessible then you might want to [use closures](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-JavaScriptclosuresactlikeimpli.aspx).\r\n\r\n#### Inheriting from classes\r\n\r\nYou can inherit one class from another by calling [WinJS.Class.derive](http://bit.ly/v48nOX). Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    (function () {\r\n        'use strict';\r\n\r\n        // constructor function\r\n        function initLine() {\r\n            // call the base constructor\r\n            Acme.Shapes.Shape.call(this, Acme.Shapes.ShapeType.Line);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        var instanceMembers = {\r\n            // overriding Shape.draw\r\n            draw: function () {\r\n                // call base\r\n                Acme.Shapes.Shape.prototype.draw.call(this);\r\n                console.log(\"Line.draw\");\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        // inherit from Shape\r\n        var Line = WinJS.Class.derive(Acme.Shapes.Shape, initLine, instanceMembers);\r\n\r\n        WinJS.Namespace.define(\"Acme.Shapes\", {\r\n            Line: Line\r\n        });\r\n    })();\r\n\r\nThe first parameter is a reference to the base class, followed by the constructor function and the instance members. Just like class definition, you can also pass static members if need be as the fourth argument. Note that when you inherit from another class, you *do not* inherit the static members. In the example above you cannot call **newId** via **Line**. You'll also note that we call base class methods via [Function.call](http://bit.ly/sTarX6) instead of directly invoking them, i.e. we do not, for instance, do the following from **Line.draw**.\r\n\r\n    Acme.Shapes.Shape.prototype.draw(); // DO NOT do this\r\n\r\nThis won't work because in this case the \"**this**\" pointer inside **Shape.draw** will point to the **Shape**'s prototype and not to the **Line** instance on which **Line.draw** was called. We will therefore need to explicitly specify the context for the call via [Function.call](http://bit.ly/sTarX6).\r\n\r\n#### Mixing functionality in\r\n\r\nLet's say you find this awesome piece of code somewhere that you think would be a great fit for one of the classes you are defining and it'd simply be too much trouble to manually copy and paste all of that code into your class definition (besides being error prone and quite simply a bad idea). In this case you can choose to \"mix-in\" that functionality into your existing class by calling [WinJS.Class.mix](http://bit.ly/ty6B6q). Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    // mix-in some functionality from somewhere; pretend\r\n    // that we got this by including a JS or something\r\n    var SuperDrawModule = {\r\n        superDraw: function() {\r\n            console.log(\"SuperDrawModule.superDraw\");\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    Line = WinJS.Class.mix(Line, SuperDrawModule);\r\n\r\nNow the method **superDraw** becomes a part of **Line** which means I can do the following now:\r\n\r\n    var l = new Acme.Shapes.Line();\r\n    l.draw();\r\n\r\n    // call mixin method\r\n    l.superDraw();\r\n\r\n#### Adding eventing capabilities\r\n\r\nWinJS ships with a useful little mixin object that automatically adds the ability to call **addEventListener**, **removeEventListener** and **dispatchEvent** on your own objects. The mixin in question is [WinJS.Utilities.eventMixin](http://bit.ly/txjWh0). Here's how you can use it:\r\n\r\n    (function () {\r\n        \"use strict\";\r\n\r\n        // constructor function\r\n        function initShape(type) {\r\n            this.id = Acme.Shapes.Shape.newId(); // calling a static member\r\n            if (type) {\r\n                this.type = type;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        var instanceMembers = {\r\n            id: null,\r\n            type: Acme.Shapes.ShapeType.None,\r\n            draw: function () {\r\n                // fire event \"draw\" via \"dispatchEvent\"\r\n                this.dispatchEvent(\"draw\", { source: this });\r\n                console.log(\"Shape.draw\");\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        var staticMembers = {\r\n            // private member\r\n            _counter: 0,\r\n            newId: function () {\r\n                return Acme.Shapes.Shape._counter++;\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        var Shape = WinJS.Class.define(initShape, instanceMembers, staticMembers);\r\n\r\n        // add eventing capability to Shape\r\n        Shape = WinJS.Class.mix(Shape, WinJS.Utilities.eventMixin);\r\n\r\n        // add to namespace\r\n        WinJS.Namespace.define(\"Acme.Shapes\", {\r\n            Shape: Shape\r\n        });\r\n    })();\r\n\r\nTake note of the lines in bold. We add the event mixin to **Shape** like any other mixin and call [eventMixin.dispatchEvent](http://bit.ly/sDaohn) to actually fire the event. Client code that handles the event would look like any other event handling code that you might have written to handle DOM events.\r\n\r\n    var l = new Acme.Shapes.Line();\r\n    l.addEventListener(\"draw\", function () {\r\n        console.log(\"Line was drawn.\");\r\n    });\r\n    l.draw();\r\n\r\nNote that stuff that you add to a base class via a mixin does in fact get inherited in sub-classes. In the sample snippet above, though the event mixin was added to **Shape** I am able to call **addEventListener** on the sub-class **Line**.\r\n\r\n#### Turning your events into properties\r\n\r\n[WinJS.Utilities.eventMixin](http://bit.ly/txjWh0) allowed us to make our classes act like DOM objects in supporting the registering of event handlers and in dispatching events. We can take things to the next level and add properties to our classes and add an alternative mechanism for registering event handlers. Our **Shape** class for instance, supports the raising of the \"draw\" event. Wouldn't it be nice if it supported a property called **ondraw** to which we can assign a callback function and have it invoked whenever the event is raised? Turns out that is exactly the sort of thing that [WinJS.Utilities.createEventProperties](http://bit.ly/u7evi6) enables. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    // add \"onevent\" properties for all events we support\r\n    var eventPropMixin = WinJS.Utilities.createEventProperties(\"initialized\", \"draw\", \"disposed\");\r\n    Shape = WinJS.Class.mix(Shape, eventPropMixin);\r\n\r\n`WinJS.Utilities.createEventProperties` basically creates a mixin object that contains properties which have the same name as the strings passed to it as parameters except for the prefixing of the word \"on\" to them. This function can accept a variable number of parameters - one for each event that your class supports. With this in place, now you can write code such as the following:\r\n\r\n    var l = new Acme.Shapes.Line();\r\n    l.ondraw = function () {\r\n        console.log(\"Line was drawn.\");\r\n    };\r\n    l.draw();\r\n\r\nOne benefit of using WinJS is that you automatically get intellisense support in VisualStudio for stuff you add to your classes using it. Here's a screen shot:\r\n\r\n> [![p1](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img13.png \"p1\")](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img12.png)\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much all I wanted to talk about.

As it turns out we can in fact do exactly that. This article walks you through the technologies that make this possible and shows how it is entirely feasible today to build interoperable web applications that provide a great user experience no matter what brand of browser the user is running.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to be one of the two or so people who have not heard about *Instagram* then you might be pleased to hear that it is a hugely popular photo sharing and social networking service that allows you to take pictures, apply interesting digital filters on them and share them with the world to see. The service got so popular that it was [acquired by Facebook](http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/04/09/breaking-facebook-buying-instagram-for-1-billion/) for a bag full of cash and stock in April of 2012.\r\n\r\n[InstaFuzz](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/arbit/InstaFuzz/) is the name of the app I put together and while I don't expect to be acquired by Facebook or anybody else for a billion green it does however make the case that an app such as this one can be built using only standards compliant web technologies such as Canvas, File API, Drag/Drop, Web Workers, ES5 and CSS3 and still manage to run well on modern browsers such as Internet Explorer 10, Google Chrome and Firefox.\r\n\r\n### About the app\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to take a look at the app, then here's where it is hosted at:\r\n\r\n> [http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/arbit/InstaFuzz/](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/arbit/InstaFuzz/)\r\n\r\nYou can download the source and run locally from [here](http://sdrv.ms/14B672O).  While this is a Visual Studio 2012 project there really isn't any server code or anything like that.  You can use your favorite editor to look at the source and run it from the file system if you are so inclined.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you load it up, you're presented with a screen that looks like this:\r\n\r\n> [![clip\\_image002](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img2.jpg \"clip_image002\")](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img1.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe idea is that you can load up a photograph into the app either by clicking on the big red \"Add\" button on the bottom left hand corner or drag and drop an image file into the blackish/blue area on the right. Once you do that you get something that looks like this:\r\n\r\n> [![clip\\_image003](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img16.png \"clip_image003\")](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img15.png)\r\n\r\nYou'll note that a list of digital filters are listed on the left of the screen showing a preview of what the image would look like if you were to apply the said filter. Applying a filter is a simple matter of clicking on one of the filter previews on the left. Here's what it looks like after applying the \"Weighted Grayscale\" filter followed by a \"Motion Blur\". As you can tell filters are *additive* - as you keep clicking on filters, they are applied on top of what was applied earlier:\r\n\r\n> [![clip\\_image004](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img18.png \"clip_image004\")](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img17.png)\r\n\r\nLet's next take a look at how the UI layout has been put together.\r\n\r\n### UI Layout\r\n\r\nThe HTML markup is actually so little that I can actually reproduce the contents of the BODY tag in its entirety here (excluding the SCRIPT includes):\r\n\r\n    <header>\r\n        <div id=\"title\">InstaFuzz</div>\r\n    </header>\r\n    <section id=\"container\">\r\n        <canvas id=\"picture\" width=\"650\" height=\"565\"></canvas>\r\n        <div id=\"controls\">\r\n            <div id=\"filters-list\"></div>\r\n            <button id=\"loadImage\">Add</button>\r\n            <input type=\"file\" id=\"fileUpload\"\r\n                   style=\"display: none;\"\r\n                   accept=\"image/gif, image/jpeg, image/png\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <!-- Handlebar template for a filter UI button -->\r\n    <script id=\"filter-template\" type=\"text/x-handlebars-template\">\r\n        <div class=\"filter-container\" data-filter-id=\"{{filterId}}\">\r\n            <div class=\"filter-name\">{{filterName}}</div>\r\n            <canvas class=\"filter-preview\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\"></canvas>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </script>\r\n\r\nThere's nothing much going on here. Pretty much everything should be standard fare. I will however draw attention to the fact that I am using the [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) JavaScript templating system here for rendering the markup for the list of filters on the left of the screen. The template markup is declared in the HTML file (the SCRIPT tag in the snippet shown above) and then used from JavaScript. The template markup is then bound to a JavaScript object that supplies the values for handlebars expressions such as *{{filterId}}* and *{{filterName}}.* Here's the relevant piece of JS from the app with a bit of DOM manipulation help from [jQuery](http://jquery.com/):\r\n\r\n    var templHtml = $(\"#filter-template\").html(),\r\n        template = Handlebars.compile(templHtml),\r\n        filtersList = $(\"#filters-list\");\r\n    var context = {\r\n        filterName: filter.name,\r\n        filterId: index\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    filtersList.append(template(context));\r\n\r\nAs you can tell from the HTML markup all the filter preview boxes feature a CANVAS tag as does the big box on the right where the final output is rendered. We'll go into a bit more detail later on in the article as to how canvas technology is used to achieve these effects.\r\n\r\nThe app also uses [CSS3 @font-face](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms530757(v=vs.85).aspx) fonts to render the text in the header and the \"Add\" button. The fonts have been taken from the excellent [Font Squirrel](http://fontsquirrel.com/) site and here's what the declaration looks like:\r\n\r\n    @font-face {\r\n        font-family: 'TizaRegular';\r\n        src: url('fonts/tiza/tiza-webfont.eot');\r\n        src: url('fonts/tiza/tiza-webfont.eot?#iefix')\r\n               format('embedded-opentype'),\r\n             url('fonts/tiza/tiza-webfont.woff') format('woff'),\r\n             url('fonts/tiza/tiza-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),\r\n             url('fonts/tiza/tiza-webfont.svg#TizaRegular') format('svg');\r\n        font-weight: normal;\r\n        font-style: normal;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis directive causes the user agent to embed the font in the page and make it available under the name assigned to the *font-family* rule which in this case is \"TizaRegular\". After this we can assign this font to any CSS *font-family* rule like how we normally do. In *InstaFuzz* I use the following rule to assign the font to the header element:\r\n\r\n    font-family: TizaRegular, Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times,\r\n       \"Times New Roman\", serif;\r\n\r\nYou might also have noticed that there is a subtle shadow being dropped on the page by the container element.\r\n\r\n> [![clip\\_image001[4]](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img20.png \"clip_image001[4]\")](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img19.png)\r\n\r\nThis is made possible using the [CSS3 box-shadow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/jj127322.aspx) rule and here's how it's used in *InstaFuzz*.\r\n\r\n    -moz-box-shadow: 1px 0px 4px #000000, -1px -1px 4px #000000;\r\n    -webkit-box-shadow: 1px 0px 4px #000000, -1px -1px 4px #000000;\r\n    box-shadow: 1px 0px 4px #000000, -1px -1px 4px #000000;\r\n\r\nThis causes the browser to render a shadow around the relevant element. Each comma separated section in the value specifies the following attributes of the shadow:\r\n\r\n1.  Horizontal offset\r\n\r\n2.  Vertical offset\r\n\r\n3.  Spread distance - positive values have the effect of softening the shadow\r\n\r\n4.  Shadow color\r\n\r\nOne can specify multiple shadow values separated by comma as in fact has been done above. Note that I've also specified the shadow using vendor prefix syntax for Firefox and Chrome/Safari using the *moz* and *webkit* prefixes. This causes the shadow to continue to work in versions of those browsers where support for this capability was provided using the vendor prefixed version of the rule. Note that the W3C version of the rule - *box-shadow* - is specified last. This is done deliberately to ensure that in case the browser supports both the forms then only the W3C behavior is actually applied to the page.\r\n\r\nOne often finds that web developers either fail to include vendor prefixed version of a given CSS3 rule for all the browsers that support that rule and/or fail to include the W3C version as well. Often developers just put the *webkit* version of the rule ignoring other browsers and the W3C standard version. This causes two problems - [1] poor user experience for users who are using non-webkit browsers and [2] it ends up resulting in webkit becoming a de-facto standard for the web. Ideally we want W3C to be driving the future of the web and not one specific browser implementation. So here are some things to remember when playing with experimental implementations of CSS features:\r\n\r\n1.  Use vendor prefixed versions of CSS rules by all means but remember to specify the rule for all supported browsers and not just the one that you happen to be testing the page in (if you're using [Visual Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products) to edit your CSS then you might be interested in the supremely excellent extension for Visual Studio called [*Web Essentials*](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6ed4c78f-a23e-49ad-b5fd-369af0c2107f) that makes the job of managing vendor prefixes about as simple as it can possibly get).\r\n\r\n2.  Remember to specify the W3C version of the rule as well.\r\n\r\n3.  Remember to order the occurrence of the rules so that the W3C version shows up last. This is to allow clients that support both the vendor prefixed version and the W3C version to use the W3C specified semantics for the rule.\r\n\r\nThat's all for now.  In the [next and final post](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-BuildinganInstagramclonePart2.aspx) in this series we'll take a look at how the app supports drag/drop of files, the use of File API, how the filters themselves work and how we prevent the UI thread from freezing by delegating the core number crunching work to web workers.\r\n","html":"<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>When I started out on this app I was only really just interested in seeing if the web platform had really evolved to a point where an app like the hugely popular <a href=\"http://instagram.com/\">Instagram</a> app could be built using just HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

Each comma separated section in the value specifies the following attributes of the shadow:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Horizontal offset</p></li>\n<li><p>Vertical offset</p></li>\n<li><p>Spread distance - positive values have the effect of softening the shadow</p></li>\n<li><p>Shadow color</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>One can specify multiple shadow values separated by comma as in fact has been done above. Note that I've also specified the shadow using vendor prefix syntax for Firefox and Chrome/Safari using the <em>moz</em> and <em>webkit</em> prefixes. This causes the shadow to continue to work in versions of those browsers where support for this capability was provided using the vendor prefixed version of the rule. Note that the W3C version of the rule - <em>box-shadow</em> - is specified last. This is done deliberately to ensure that in case the browser supports both the forms then only the W3C behavior is actually applied to the page.</p>\n\n<p>One often finds that web developers either fail to include vendor prefixed version of a given CSS3 rule for all the browsers that support that rule and/or fail to include the W3C version as well. Often developers just put the <em>webkit</em> version of the rule ignoring other browsers and the W3C standard version. This causes two problems - [1] poor user experience for users who are using non-webkit browsers and [2] it ends up resulting in webkit becoming a de-facto standard for the web. Ideally we want W3C to be driving the future of the web and not one specific browser implementation. So here are some things to remember when playing with experimental implementations of CSS features:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Use vendor prefixed versions of CSS rules by all means but remember to specify the rule for all supported browsers and not just the one that you happen to be testing the page in (if you're using <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products\">Visual Studio</a> to edit your CSS then you might be interested in the supremely excellent extension for Visual Studio called <a href=\"http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6ed4c78f-a23e-49ad-b5fd-369af0c2107f\"><em>Web Essentials</em></a> that makes the job of managing vendor prefixes about as simple as it can possibly get).</p></li>\n<li><p>Remember to specify the W3C version of the rule as well.</p></li>\n<li><p>Remember to order the occurrence of the rules so that the W3C version shows up last. This is to allow clients that support both the vendor prefixed version and the W3C version to use the W3C specified semantics for the rule.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That's all for now.  In the <a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-BuildinganInstagramclonePart2.aspx\">next and final post</a> in this series we'll take a look at how the app supports drag/drop of files, the use of File API, how the filters themselves work and how we prevent the UI thread from freezing by delegating the core number crunching work to web workers.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1366200086837,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1366345345837,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1366200086837,"published_by":1},{"id":42,"uuid":"2923216c-d0d1-4e07-9753-5bb9eef50689","title":"Forced software updates?","slug":"forcedsoftwareupdates","markdown":"Vendors of \"free\" software programs have started getting into this annoying habit of forcing updates down users throats these days!

Here's the scenario: I had a simple in-process COM component configured to run in a [single threaded apartment](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680112.aspx) (STA). The STA apartment configuration, if you didn't know, is an indication to the COM runtime that the component does not know anything about thread synchronization and will miserably stomp over itself and do other unpleasant things if unbridled concurrent access to an instance of it is made available from multiple threads. Wanting to test whether the COM runtime's call serialization guarantee would continue to hold true even when we remote an in-process component to remote processes via the ROT, I put together a quick sample containing the following:\n\n-   A simple in-process STA COM component named `Dong` that contained a single method, again, called `Dong` that simply popped up a message box to announce to the world the fact that it had indeed been found worthy of being invoked.\n\n-   A console application called *AddToROT.exe* that created an instance of `Dong` and added it to the ROT. After that it hung around running a windows message loop set to terminate upon a key press. The message loop is needed because the COM runtime's call serialization implementation depends on it. We'll learn why exactly in a moment. Here's what the loop looks like:\n\n        while( !_kbhit() )\n        {\n            MSG msg;\n            if( PeekMessage( &msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE ) )\n            {\n                TranslateMessage( &msg );\n                DispatchMessage( &msg );\n            }\n            else\n                Sleep( 500 );\n        }\n\n    As you can see, a fairly straightforward message loop that keeps spinning till you hit a key on the keyboard.\n\n-   The last piece in the sample was a console application called *GetFromROT.exe* that fetched a reference to `Dong` from the ROT and invoked its sole method.\n\nMy plan was to first run *AddToROT* and then launch multiple instances of *GetFromROT*. I expected that the message box from `Dong.Dong()` would get displayed one after the other even though the client processes were running more or less concurrently. I expected this because that's what the COM runtime guarantees for components marked as an STA. How exactly does it provide this guarantee? It's quite simple actually.\n\nWhenever a method call is made on a component from the thread on which it was created, it behaves like a regular method call, i.e. your call results in a simple transfer of control to the called method in the component. When you wish to call the method from another thread however, the COM powers that be have mandated that you first *marshal* the interface pointer across the thread boundary before invoking methods on it. You do this via `CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream` and `CoGetInterfaceAndReleaseStream`, i.e. you call the former from the thread on which the component was created to be handed an `IStream` pointer which you somehow pass to the second thread from where you call the latter to be handed a component pointer which in turn you can use to call its methods. If you do all this the COM runtime guarantees that the calls will get serialized and peace shall reign everywhere.\n\nNow if all that sounds a bit confusing here's a small code snippet that'll hopefully clear the air for you (the code below is meant to just illustrate the concept which means that there are no error checks; and what's more, it won't even compile!).\n\n### Thread 1\n\n    //\n    // let's assume this is a global variable\n    //\n    IStream *g_pStream;\n\n    //\n    // create an instance of dong\n    //\n    IDong *pDong;\n    CoCreateInstance( ..., &pDong );\n\n    //\n    // marshal the interface pointer into a stream\n    //\n    CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream(\n       __uuidof( IDong ),\n       pDong,\n       &g_pStream );\n\n    //\n    // simple straightforward method call\n    //\n    pDong->Dong();\n\n### Thread 2\n\n    IDong *pDong;\n\n    //\n    // un-marshal the interface pointer\n    //\n    CoGetInterfaceAndReleaseStream(\n       g_pStream,\n       __uuidof( IDong ),\n       &pDong );\n\n    //\n    // \"pDong\" is in truth a proxy object that marshalls the call\n    // across thread/process boundaries; the COM runtime ensures that\n    // the component gets only one call at a time\n    //\n    pDong->Dong();\n\nNow that you know how marshalling interface pointers across threads is accomplished, let's go back to our question of how the COM runtime provides the call serialization guarantee and what it has to do with running message loops. As it turns out whenever you create an STA COM component, the COM runtime secretly goes and creates a hidden window. When you marshal the interface pointer across to another thread (or another process for that matter) what you are actually handed is a proxy object. When you invoke a method on the proxy all that it does is to serialize the method parameters and post (or rather, *send*) a regular window message to the hidden window. The window procedure that handles the message unpacks the parameters and calls the method on the actual component. Simple! No matter how many concurrent clients exist for the component, as long as all the method calls are routed through the hidden window, call serialization is automatically guaranteed!\n\nAs must be evident, in order for windows (hidden or otherwise) to receive messages there **must** be a message loop that's retrieving and dispatching the messages. This is the reason why COM's call serialization guarantee works only so long as the thread on which the component was created has a message loop going. So far so good!\n\nIn our sample setup therefore you couldn't have blamed me too much for expecting that when I run 2 instances of *GetFromROT* one after the other without dismissing the message box shown as a result of the first instance the 2nd instance would essentially block on the method call till I dismissed the first message box. After it had been dismissed however I would see the message box appearing a second time, courtesy the 2nd instance of *GetFromROT*. Here's a screenshot of what I actually saw!\n\n> ![](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/concsta-s1.png)\n\nAs you can see, the second instance of *GetFromROT* was also somehow given access to `Dong` while the first invocation still hadn't returned! What's even more stranger is that both the calls seem to have occurred on the same thread!! This is evident from the fact that both the message boxes show the same thread ID as returned by the `GetCurrentThreadId` API.\n\nFor a couple of days there I walked about with tousled hair, unshaved chin and rumpled shirt with a murderous look in my eye. What has world come to if one can't trust the COM runtime to do what it had promised to do?! This sorry state of affairs ended finally one day as I was performing my morning ablutions (and I could hear mother nature letting out a sigh of relief) when it dawned upon me with startling clarity that the windows message box spawns a little message loop of its own!\n\nThat was indeed the problem here! As it turns out whenever you pop up a message box (or any modal dialog box for that matter) a local message loop is executed from that dialog. This is done because of the modal nature of the dialog. The thread that has the message pump running is now blocked on the call to the modal dialog which means that the message pump isn't doing a whole lot while the dialog is active. It would also mean that the dialog itself would remain unresponsive since there's nobody picking the messages from the queue and having it processed. To counter all this, modal dialog boxes always run their own message loop till the dialog is dismissed.\n\nSo, in our case the 2nd call to `Dong.Dong` was facilitated not by the message loop running in *AddToROT* but from the one running in the message box that had been invoked from the previous call to `Dong.Dong`. We can easily verify this by taking a look at the call-stack of the primary thread in *AddToROT* while `Dong.Dong` is running.\n\nHere's the call-stack while the message box is being shown as a result of running the first instance of *GetFromROT*. The stack was captured using the excellent [Process Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.mspx) tool written by [Mark Russinovich](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/techfellow/Russinovich/default.mspx) of [Sysinternals](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx) fame.

Inadvertently our STA component has actually become re-entrant! The behaviour we were expecting to see is evident the moment you change the `MessageBox` call to a `_tprintf` and make the method wait for user input via a call to `_getch`. The following implementation of `Dong.Dong` causes the second launch of *GetFromROT* to wait till the first launch has been responded to by the pressing a key in the *AddToROT* console window.\n\n    STDMETHODIMP CDong::Dong(LONG* plRetVal)\n    {\n        *plRetVal = 50;\n\n        TCHAR szBuf[1024];\n        _stprintf( szBuf, _T( \"Dong - Thread ID = 0x%X, \" \\\n        \"Object ID = %d\\n\" ),\n            GetCurrentThreadId(), m_iObjectID );\n        _tprintf( _T( \"%s\\nPress any key to return from \"\\\n        \"CDong::Dong\\n\" ), szBuf );\n        _getch();\n        return S_OK;\n    }\n\nA nasty sort of issue to run into wouldn't you think?!","html":"<p>I was recently experimenting with the Windows <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms695276.aspx\">Running Object Table</a> (ROT) when I ran into a peculiar problem.

You do this via <code>CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream</code> and <code>CoGetInterfaceAndReleaseStream</code>, i.e. you call the former from the thread on which the component was created to be handed an <code>IStream</code> pointer which you somehow pass to the second thread from where you call the latter to be handed a component pointer which in turn you can use to call its methods. If you do all this the COM runtime guarantees that the calls will get serialized and peace shall reign everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Now if all that sounds a bit confusing here's a small code snippet that'll hopefully clear the air for you (the code below is meant to just illustrate the concept which means that there are no error checks; and what's more, it won't even compile!).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"thread1\">Thread 1</h3>\n\n<pre><code>//\n// let's assume this is a global variable\n//\nIStream *g_pStream;\n\n//\n// create an instance of dong\n//\nIDong *pDong;\nCoCreateInstance( ..., &amp;pDong );\n\n//\n// marshal the interface pointer into a stream\n//\nCoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream(\n   __uuidof( IDong ),\n   pDong,\n   &amp;g_pStream );\n\n//\n// simple straightforward method call\n//\npDong-&gt;Dong();\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"thread2\">Thread 2</h3>\n\n<pre><code>IDong *pDong;\n\n//\n// un-marshal the interface pointer\n//\nCoGetInterfaceAndReleaseStream(\n   g_pStream,\n   __uuidof( IDong ),\n   &amp;pDong );\n\n//\n// \"pDong\" is in truth a proxy object that marshalls the call\n// across thread/process boundaries; the COM runtime ensures that\n// the component gets only one call at a time\n//\npDong-&gt;Dong();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now that you know how marshalling interface pointers across threads is accomplished, let's go back to our question of how the COM runtime provides the call serialization guarantee and what it has to do with running message loops. As it turns out whenever you create an STA COM component, the COM runtime secretly goes and creates a hidden window. When you marshal the interface pointer across to another thread (or another process for that matter) what you are actually handed is a proxy object. When you invoke a method on the proxy all that it does is to serialize the method parameters and post (or rather, <em>send</em>) a regular window message to the hidden window. The window procedure that handles the message unpacks the parameters and calls the method on the actual component. Simple! No matter how many concurrent clients exist for the component, as long as all the method calls are routed through the hidden window, call serialization is automatically guaranteed!</p>\n\n<p>As must be evident, in order for windows (hidden or otherwise) to receive messages there <strong>must</strong> be a message loop that's retrieving and dispatching the messages. This is the reason why COM's call serialization guarantee works only so long as the thread on which the component was created has a message loop going. So far so good!</p>\n\n<p>In our sample setup therefore you couldn't have blamed me too much for expecting that when I run 2 instances of <em>GetFromROT</em> one after the other without dismissing the message box shown as a result of the first instance the 2nd instance would essentially block on the method call till I dismissed the first message box. After it had been dismissed however I would see the message box appearing a second time, courtesy the 2nd instance of <em>GetFromROT</em>. Here's a screenshot of what I actually saw!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/concsta-s1.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, the second instance of <em>GetFromROT</em> was also somehow given access to <code>Dong</code> while the first invocation still hadn't returned! What's even more stranger is that both the calls seem to have occurred on the same thread!! This is evident from the fact that both the message boxes show the same thread ID as returned by the <code>GetCurrentThreadId</code> API.</p>\n\n<p>For a couple of days there I walked about with tousled hair, unshaved chin and rumpled shirt with a murderous look in my eye. What has world come to if one can't trust the COM runtime to do what it had promised to do?! This sorry state of affairs ended finally one day as I was performing my morning ablutions (and I could hear mother nature letting out a sigh of relief) when it dawned upon me with startling clarity that the windows message box spawns a little message loop of its own!</p>\n\n<p>That was indeed the problem here! As it turns out whenever you pop up a message box (or any modal dialog box for that matter) a local message loop is executed from that dialog. This is done because of the modal nature of the dialog. The thread that has the message pump running is now blocked on the call to the modal dialog which means that the message pump isn't doing a whole lot while the dialog is active. It would also mean that the dialog itself would remain unresponsive since there's nobody picking the messages from the queue and having it processed. To counter all this, modal dialog boxes always run their own message loop till the dialog is dismissed.</p>\n\n<p>So, in our case the 2nd call to <code>Dong.Dong</code> was facilitated not by the message loop running in <em>AddToROT</em> but from the one running in the message box that had been invoked from the previous call to <code>Dong.Dong</code>. We can easily verify this by taking a look at the call-stack of the primary thread in <em>AddToROT</em> while <code>Dong.Dong</code> is running.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the call-stack while the message box is being shown as a result of running the first instance of <em>GetFromROT</em>. The stack was captured using the excellent <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.mspx\">Process Explorer</a> tool written by <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/techfellow/Russinovich/default.mspx\">Mark Russinovich</a> of <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx\">Sysinternals</a> fame.

I at first started off with a simple window and set its size to what I wanted.\n\n    <Window x:Class=\"TextboxApp.Window1\"\n            xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n            xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n            Title=\"Freebase Search\"\n            Height=\"65\"\n            WindowStyle=\"None\"\n            Width=\"708\"\n            MinHeight=\"65\"\n            MinWidth=\"400\"\n            WindowStartupLocation=\"CenterScreen\"\n            x:Name=\"MainWindow\">\n    ...\n\nI then plonked a `DockPanel` into the window with a `TextBox` in it.\n\n    <DockPanel Background=\"Transparent\">\n        <TextBox x:Name=\"txtSearch\"\n                 FontSize=\"40\"\n                 TextAlignment=\"Center\"\n                 VerticalAlignment=\"Center\"\n                 Foreground=\"Wheat\"\n        </TextBox>\n    </DockPanel>\n\nI wanted a swanky gradient background and also get the nice rounded corners for the window. After a few attempts with less than stellar results I settled upon the following structure.\n\n    <DockPanel Background=\"Transparent\">\n        <Border CornerRadius=\"9,9,9,9\">\n            <Border.Background>\n                <LinearGradientBrush StartPoint=\"0,0\" EndPoint=\"2,1\" x:Name=\"WindowBackground\">\n                    <GradientStop Color=\"#CC000000\"  Offset=\"0.0\" />\n                    <GradientStop Color=\"#CCFFFFFF\" Offset=\"1.0\" />\n                </LinearGradientBrush>\n            </Border.Background>\n            <TextBox x:Name=\"txtSearch\"\n                     FontSize=\"40\"\n                     TextAlignment=\"Center\"\n                     VerticalAlignment=\"Center\"\n                     KeyDown=\"txtSearch_KeyDown\"\n                     Background=\"Transparent\"\n                     Foreground=\"Wheat\"\n                     BorderBrush=\"Transparent\"\n                     BorderThickness=\"0\"\n                     Visibility=\"Hidden\">\n            </TextBox>\n        </Border>\n    </DockPanel>\n\nI now had a textbox with nice rounded corners but the window itself was a standard rectangle. A little googling revealed the pixy dust you've got to sprinkle to get it going. First you enable transparency on the window itself and make its background transparent like so (note the tags in bold below):\n\n    <Window x:Class=\"TextboxApp.MainWindow\"\n            xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n            xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n            Title=\"Freebase Search\"\n            Height=\"65\"\n            Width=\"708\"\n            WindowStyle=\"None\"\n            MinHeight=\"65\"\n            MinWidth=\"400\"\n            WindowStartupLocation=\"CenterScreen\"\n            x:Name=\"TheMainWindow\"\n            AllowsTransparency=\"True\"\n            Background=\"Transparent\"\n            ShowInTaskbar=\"False\">\n\nThe basic idea is to make all backgrounds and borders transparent except for the `Border` tag in the `DockPanel` so that only the rouned corners in the border element are visible. Here's the modified code (again, note the stuff in bold):\n\n    <DockPanel Background=\"Transparent\">\n        <Border CornerRadius=\"9,9,9,9\">\n            <Border.Background>\n                <LinearGradientBrush StartPoint=\"0,0\" EndPoint=\"2,1\" x:Name=\"WindowBackground\">\n                    <GradientStop Color=\"#CC000000\"  Offset=\"0.0\" />\n                    <GradientStop Color=\"#CCFFFFFF\" Offset=\"1.0\" />\n                </LinearGradientBrush>\n            </Border.Background>\n            <TextBox x:Name=\"txtSearch\"\n                     FontSize=\"40\"\n                     TextAlignment=\"Center\"\n                     VerticalAlignment=\"Center\"\n                     KeyDown=\"txtSearch_KeyDown\"\n                     Background=\"Transparent\"\n                     Foreground=\"Wheat\"\n                     BorderBrush=\"Transparent\"\n                     BorderThickness=\"0\">\n            </TextBox>\n        </Border>\n    </DockPanel>\n\nThat's it! Now I had the nice custom round cornered window! I added some pizzazz with some fade-in/fade-out animation and I was in business!\n\n![Screenshot of the search textbox.](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/cwin.png)\n\nIf you'd like to take a look at the code, here's the link you'll need.\n\n-   [Download Source](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/downloads/TextboxAppSrc.zip)\n","html":"<p>I am working on a little <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation\">WPF</a> app to build a UI for the <a href=\"http://www.freebase.com/\">Freebase</a> web database and decided that the entry point to the app will be a simple textbox where the user can type in the search text.

First you enable transparency on the window itself and make its background transparent like so (note the tags in bold below):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Window x:Class=\"TextboxApp.MainWindow\"\n        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        Title=\"Freebase Search\"\n        Height=\"65\"\n        Width=\"708\"\n        WindowStyle=\"None\"\n        MinHeight=\"65\"\n        MinWidth=\"400\"\n        WindowStartupLocation=\"CenterScreen\"\n        x:Name=\"TheMainWindow\"\n        AllowsTransparency=\"True\"\n        Background=\"Transparent\"\n        ShowInTaskbar=\"False\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The basic idea is to make all backgrounds and borders transparent except for the <code>Border</code> tag in the <code>DockPanel</code> so that only the rouned corners in the border element are visible. Here's the modified code (again, note the stuff in bold):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;DockPanel Background=\"Transparent\"&gt;\n    &lt;Border CornerRadius=\"9,9,9,9\"&gt;\n        &lt;Border.Background&gt;\n            &lt;LinearGradientBrush StartPoint=\"0,0\" EndPoint=\"2,1\" x:Name=\"WindowBackground\"&gt;\n                &lt;GradientStop Color=\"#CC000000\"  Offset=\"0.0\" /&gt;\n                &lt;GradientStop Color=\"#CCFFFFFF\" Offset=\"1.0\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/LinearGradientBrush&gt;\n        &lt;/Border.Background&gt;\n        &lt;TextBox x:Name=\"txtSearch\"\n                 FontSize=\"40\"\n                 TextAlignment=\"Center\"\n                 VerticalAlignment=\"Center\"\n                 KeyDown=\"txtSearch_KeyDown\"\n                 Background=\"Transparent\"\n                 Foreground=\"Wheat\"\n                 BorderBrush=\"Transparent\"\n                 BorderThickness=\"0\"&gt;\n        &lt;/TextBox&gt;\n    &lt;/Border&gt;\n&lt;/DockPanel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That's it! Now I had the nice custom round cornered window! I added some pizzazz with some fade-in/fade-out animation and I was in business!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/cwin.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the search textbox.\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you'd like to take a look at the code, here's the link you'll need.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/downloads/TextboxAppSrc.zip\">Download Source</a></li>\n</ul>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1236698227473,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1398533059960,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1236698227473,"published_by":1},{"id":48,"uuid":"a5a904a7-f7d0-4ba1-a721-ba2e936628f8","title":"How to create a simple Workflow Foundation (WF) activity","slug":"howtocreatingasimpleworkflowfo","markdown":"Quite suddenly, with no prior warning whatsoever, I resolved with firm determination that I will without further delay inflict upon unsuspecting world, my first screen recorded, poorly narrated technical tutorial.

Somebody wondered if that video could have been built with a HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3 solution and I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nThe basic idea was to show a sequence of \"scenes\" where each scene animates one or more HTML elements in some fashion. My first choice was to consider using CSS3 transitions but given that I wanted this to work in Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) which does not support CSS3 transitions, I decided to go with a JavaScript based animation approach.\n\nBeing an ardent [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) user I thought I'd extend jQuery's effects system (primarily via the `animate` function) by writing a little plugin that would let me animate CSS3 2D transform matrices. I couldn't use `jQuery.animate` as is because it requires the property being animated to be a numeric value (width, opacity, left, top etc.) and CSS3 2D transform values are essentially 3x2 matrices.\n\n### So what are CSS3 2D Transforms?\n\nBefore we talk about the plugin though let's quickly review how CSS3 2D transforms work. Here's a `div` for example that has been rotated clock-wise about its center by 45 degrees (you'll need to use IE9 or a recent version of Firefox, Chrome, Safari or Opera to see the rotation):\n\n> <div style=\"text-align: center; font-style: normal; font-size: 23px; line-height: 60px; background-color: black; margin-top: 20px; width: 60px; font-family: cambria, cochin, georgia, times, serif; margin-bottom: 20px; height: 60px; color: white; font-weight: bold; -o-transform: rotate(45deg); -moz-transform: rotate(45deg); -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg); -ms-transform: rotate(45deg); transform: rotate(45deg); -o-box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; -moz-box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; -webkit-box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; -moz-border-radius: 2px; -webkit-border-radius: 2px; -o-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 2px\">:-)</div>\n\nThe rotation was achieved by a bit of CSS3 code like so:\n\n    transform: rotate(45deg);\n\nSince the CSS3 2D transform spec is a [working draft standard](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs#transform2d) at the time of this writing, all browsers currently provide support for this only through vendor prefixed CSS3 attributes. So to make this work today you'd have to actually write all of the following:\n\n    -o-transform: rotate(45deg);\n    -moz-transform: rotate(45deg);\n    -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg);\n    -ms-transform: rotate(45deg);\n    transform: rotate(45deg);\n\nThe vendor prefixes given above are for Opera, Firefox (Mozilla), WebKit based browsers (Chrome and Safari) and IE - in that order. Note that I have supplied the standard name for the attribute - \"`transform`\" - last in the list. This has been deliberately done so that when these browsers do start supporting the standard name for the attribute, that behavior (i.e., the standard behavior) will take precedence over the vendor prefixed versions by virtue of it showing up last in the rule.\n\nApart from rotation, the spec also supports the specification of translation, scaling and skew transforms. Multiple transforms can be applied to a single element at the same time by separating each transform by a space. Here's another `div` that has been rotated about its center by 45 degrees and skewed along the X axis by 15 degrees.\n\n> <div style=\"text-align: center; font-style: normal; font-size: 23px; line-height: 60px; background-color: black; margin-top: 30px; width: 60px; font-family: cambria, cochin, georgia, times, serif; margin-bottom: 30px; height: 60px; color: white; font-weight: bold; -o-transform: rotate(45deg) skewx(15deg); -moz-transform: rotate(45deg) skewx(15deg); -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg) skewx(15deg); -ms-transform: rotate(45deg) skewx(15deg); transform: rotate(45deg) skewx(15deg); -o-box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; -moz-box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; -webkit-box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; -moz-border-radius: 2px; -webkit-border-radius: 2px; -o-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 2px\">:-)</div>\n\nAnd here're the CSS3 rules that produced this output:\n\n    -o-transform: rotate(45deg) skewX(15deg);\n    -moz-transform: rotate(45deg) skewX(15deg);\n    -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg) skewX(15deg);\n    -ms-transform: rotate(45deg) skewX(15deg);\n    transform: rotate(45deg) skewX(15deg);\n\n### Reading transform data back from the element\n\nNow that we have the basic transform applied, let's see what we get back if we query the transform via jQuery. We use jQuery's [`css`](http://api.jquery.com/css/) function to retrieve the value. On IE9 for instance here's the code you'd use to get the transform:\n\n    var transform = $(\"div\").css(\"msTransform\");\n\nAnd here's the value IE9 returns for the second `div `above (the one which has both a rotate and a skew applied):\n\n    matrix(0.707107, 0.707107, -0.517638, 0.896575, 0, 0)\n\nAs you can tell, that doesn't look anything like the way we specified the transform. It turns out that the browser is free to convert our transform specification into a matrix representation and discard the original string given in the style sheet. As you might expect we can also specify the transform in this format, should we choose to do so, instead of using the the syntax we used earlier. While we are reviewing matrices, it might be useful to consider the following matrix - known as the *identity matrix*. This is a transform matrix applying which produces basically no change in the source matrix - similar to the effect that multiplying a number by one produces on it.\n\n    matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)\n\nSince we'll need to work with these numbers individually, it might be useful to write a helper routine that can parse a string in this form and produce an array of 6 numbers.\n\n    (function ($) {\n        //\n        // regular expression for parsing out the matrix\n        // components from the matrix string\n        //\n        var matrixRE = /\\([0-9epx\\.\\, \\t\\-]+/gi;\n\n        //\n        // parses a matrix string of the form\n        // \"matrix(n1,n2,n3,n4,n5,n6)\" and\n        // returns an array with the matrix\n        // components\n        //\n        var parseMatrix = function (val) {\n            return val.match(matrixRE)[0].substr(1).\n                      split(\",\").map(function (s) {\n                return parseFloat(s);\n            });\n        }\n    })(jQuery);\n\nWe basically use a regular expression to extract the relevant portion and convert it into an array of numbers. You'll note that I've used the self-calling anonymous function technique above. This was done to prevent polluting the global namespace with variables such as `matrixRE`.\n\nAnother factor to consider while reading transform matrix values back from the DOM is the fact that browsers today implement CSS3 2D transforms through vendor prefixes. This means that code such as the following, where we use the standard name for the CSS attribute, simply won't work!\n\n    var transform = $(\"div\").css(\"transform\");\n\nWe're going to have to use the appropriate vendor prefix while setting and retrieving transform matrices from script. As this can quickly get quite cumbersome to do, it makes sense to wrap this activity up in a couple of utility routines. Here goes:\n\n    (function ($) {\n        //\n        // transform css property names with vendor prefixes; the plugin\n        // will check for values in the order the names are listed here and\n        // return as soon as there is a value; so listing the W3 std name\n        // for the transform results in that being used if its available\n        //\n        var transformPropNames = [\n            \"transform\",\n            \"msTransform\",\n            \"-webkit-transform\",\n            \"-moz-transform\",\n            \"-o-transform\"\n        ];\n\n        var getTransformMatrix = function (el) {\n            //\n            // iterate through the css3 identifiers till we\n            // hit one that yields a value\n            //\n            var matrix = null;\n            transformPropNames.some(function (prop) {\n                matrix = el.css(prop);\n                return (matrix !== null && matrix !== \"\");\n            });\n\n            //\n            // if \"none\" then we supplant it with an identity matrix so\n            // that our parsing code below doesn't break\n            //\n            matrix = (!matrix || matrix === \"none\") ?\n                          \"matrix(1,0,0,1,0,0)\" : matrix;\n            return parseMatrix(matrix);\n        };\n\n        //\n        // set the given matrix transform on the element; note that we\n        // apply the css transforms in reverse order of how its given\n        // in \"transformPropName\" to ensure that the std compliant prop\n        // name shows up last\n        //\n        var setTransformMatrix = function (el, matrix) {\n            var m = \"matrix(\" + matrix.join(\",\") + \")\";\n            for (var i = transformPropNames.length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {\n                el.css(transformPropNames[i], m);\n            }\n        };\n    })(jQuery);\n\nWith these functions handy, we can set and retrieve transforms like so and it should work well on all modern browsers:\n\n    setTransformMatrix($(\"div\"),\n       [0.707107, 0.707107, -0.517638, 0.896575, 0, 0]);\n    var matrix = getTransformMatrix($(\"div\"));\n\n### The jQuery plugin\n\nThe jQuery plugin uses jQuery's animation function to take advantage of its \"easing\" system. The animation is driven by having jQuery animate a phantom property called \"percentAnim\" from 0 through 100 on the element(s) in question and uses the \"step\" callback function to guide the actual animation of the transform matrix. Here's the source of the jQuery plugin (assuming the functions defined above are available):\n\n    (function ($) {\n        //\n        // interpolates a value between a range given a percent\n        //\n        var interpolate = function (from, to, percent) {\n            return from + ((to - from) * (percent / 100));\n        }\n\n        $.fn.transformAnimate = function (opt) {\n            //\n            // extend the options passed in by caller\n            //\n            var options = {\n                transform: \"matrix(1,0,0,1,0,0)\"\n            };\n            $.extend(options, opt);\n\n            //\n            // initialize our custom property on the element\n            // to track animation progress\n            //\n            this.css(\"percentAnim\", 0);\n\n            //\n            // supplant \"options.step\" if it exists with our own\n            // routine\n            //\n            var sourceTransform = getTransformMatrix(this);\n            var targetTransform = parseMatrix(options.transform);\n            options.step = function (percentAnim, fx) {\n                //\n                // compute the interpolated transform matrix for\n                // the current animation progress\n                //\n                var $this = $(this);\n                var matrix = sourceTransform.map(function (c, i) {\n                    return interpolate(c, targetTransform[i], percentAnim);\n                });\n\n                //\n                // apply the new matrix\n                //\n                setTransformMatrix($this, matrix);\n\n                //\n                // invoke caller's version of \"step\" if one was supplied;\n                //\n                if (opt.step) {\n                    opt.step.apply(this, [matrix, fx]);\n                }\n            };\n\n            //\n            // animate!\n            //\n            return this.animate({ percentAnim: 100 }, options);\n        };\n    })(jQuery);\n\nThere isn't a whole lot going on there. The \"step\" function is called by jQuery every time a frame update is needed. It passes the current value of the property jQuery is animating over the given duration as an argument to the \"step\" function. In our case this will be a number that ranges between 0 and 100 and we take it as an indication of how far we are into the animation and use it to appropriately interpolate the values in the transform matrix. Here's an example of how we might use this function to translate and rotate an element over 1 second:\n\n    var box = $(\"#box\");\n    box.transformAnimate({\n        transform: \"matrix(-0.707107, 0.707107, \" +\n                     \"-0.707107, -0.707107, 150, 0)\",\n        duration: 1000\n    });\n\nIf you're wondering how I got those numbers in the matrix, well, I used the JavaScript console that ships as a part of IE9's debugging tools (just hit F12 if you're running IE) and then manually applied the said transform and then retrieved the resulting matrix via jQuery! Not exactly rocket science, I know!\n\nThe jQuery plugin has been used to trigger an animation on the box shown below when you click on it. It uses the animation plugin defined above to translate the box 150 pixels along the X axis and also rotate it 135 degrees around the center in a clock-wise direction over 1 second and then does the reverse.

So I figured I'll just use my plugin to get it done. Turns out it isn't quite as simple as that! The problem you see is that the plugin works purely by interpolating the values of the transform matrix from the source to the target matrix over the given duration. Interpolation does not imply that things will progress in a linear fashion. For example, imagine that I wish to rotate an element from 0 degrees through 270 degrees. One can achieve this by incrementing the rotation angle from 0 to 270. However, when represented as a transform matrix it turns out that we can just as easily achieve this by rotating counter-clockwise from 0 degrees to -90 degrees! Not quite what we want! To make this kind of mindless animation work I had to put together a mini-animation framework (if you can call it that) myself.\n\nFirst, I copied the `setTransformMatrix` function from the transform jQuery plugin:\n\n    var Utils = {\n        //\n        // utility for applying transform matrix\n        //\n        applyTransform: (function () {\n            var transformPropNames = [\n                \"transform\",\n                \"msTransform\",\n                \"-webkit-transform\",\n                \"-moz-transform\",\n                \"-o-transform\"\n            ];\n\n            return function (el, transform) {\n                for (var i = transformPropNames.length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {\n                    el.css(transformPropNames[i], transform);\n                }\n            };\n        })()\n    };\n\nAnd then implemented a simple animate routine whose job is to simply invoke a callback function at a predefined interval for a specified duration.\n\n    var Utils = {\n        //\n        // simple custom animation\n        //\n        animate: (function () {\n            var ANIMATION_INTERVAL = 17;\n\n            return function (duration, frame, done) {\n                var start = Date.now();\n\n                //\n                // our animation routine\n                //\n                var anim = function () {\n                    //\n                    // compute animation progress\n                    //\n                    var elapsed = (Date.now() - start);\n                    var percent = elapsed / duration;\n\n                    //\n                    // invoke callback\n                    //\n                    frame(percent);\n\n                    //\n                    // schedule next frame update if need be\n                    //\n                    if (elapsed < duration) {\n                        window.setTimeout(anim, ANIMATION_INTERVAL);\n                    } else {\n                        done();\n                    }\n                };\n\n                //\n                // schedule first frame update\n                //\n                window.setTimeout(anim, ANIMATION_INTERVAL);\n            };\n        })()\n    };\n\nFinally, I put together a routine to animate the transform by animating the transform options individually, i.e., you can for instance, translate along Y axis from 10 pixels to 200 pixels and skew along X axis from 20 degrees to 0 degrees and so forth. Here's the function definition:\n\n    var Utils = {\n        //\n        // wrapper for animating transforms; \"opt\" might look like this:\n        //  opt: {\n        //      scale: {\n        //          from: 0.01, to: 1.0\n        //      },\n        //      rotate: {\n        //          from: 0.0, to: 360.0 * 2.0\n        //      },\n        //      translateX: {\n        //          from: 10, to: 300\n        //      }\n        //  }\n        //\n        transformAnimate: (function () {\n            var suffix = {\n                scale: \"\",\n                scaleX: \"\",\n                scaleY: \"\",\n                rotate: \"deg\",\n                translate: \"px\",\n                translateX: \"px\",\n                translateY: \"px\",\n                skew: \"deg\",\n                skewX: \"deg\",\n                skewY: \"deg\"\n            };\n\n            return function (duration, el, opt, done) {\n                Utils.animate(duration, function (percent) {\n                    var transform = \"\";\n                    for (var p in opt) {\n                        var val = opt[p].from +\n                            ((opt[p].to - opt[p].from) * percent);\n                        transform += sprintf(\"%s(%f%s) \",\n                                       p, val, suffix[p]);\n                    }\n                    Utils.applyTransform(el, transform);\n                }, done);\n            };\n        })()\n    };\n\nIf I wanted to implement the same animation I did earlier, i.e. translate the box 150 pixels along the X axis and also rotate it 135 degrees around the center in a clock-wise direction over 1 second using this new framework, then I'd do something like this:\n\n    Utils.transformAnimate(1000, $(\"#box1\"), {\n            translateX: { from: 0.0, to: 150.0 },\n            rotate: { from: 0.0, to: 135.0 }\n    }, function() {});\n\nHere's another box for you that you can click to make it rotate and translate a bit.\n\n> <div style=\"text-align: center;

it just so happened that boss was the target this time but it might just as well have been yours truly or anybody else) and I contributed to the joint exercise with a little video cooked up with <a href=\"http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker?os=other\">Windows Live Movie Maker</a> (nope, I am <em>not</em> posting the video here!). Somebody wondered if that video could have been built with a HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3 solution and I figured I'd give it a shot.</p>\n\n<p>The basic idea was to show a sequence of \"scenes\" where each scene animates one or more HTML elements in some fashion. My first choice was to consider using CSS3 transitions but given that I wanted this to work in Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) which does not support CSS3 transitions, I decided to go with a JavaScript based animation approach.</p>\n\n<p>Being an ardent <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> user I thought I'd extend jQuery's effects system (primarily via the <code>animate</code> function) by writing a little plugin that would let me animate CSS3 2D transform matrices. I couldn't use <code>jQuery.animate</code> as is because it requires the property being animated to be a numeric value (width, opacity, left, top etc.) and CSS3 2D transform values are essentially 3x2 matrices.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sowhatarecss32dtransforms\">So what are CSS3 2D Transforms?</h3>\n\n<p>Before we talk about the plugin though let's quickly review how CSS3 2D transforms work. Here's a <code>div</code> for example that has been rotated clock-wise about its center by 45 degrees (you'll need to use IE9 or a recent version of Firefox, Chrome, Safari or Opera to see the rotation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <div style=\"text-align: center; font-style: normal; font-size: 23px; line-height: 60px; background-color: black; margin-top: 20px; width: 60px; font-family: cambria, cochin, georgia, times, serif; margin-bottom: 20px; height: 60px; color: white; font-weight: bold; -o-transform: rotate(45deg); -moz-transform: rotate(45deg); -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg); -ms-transform: rotate(45deg); transform: rotate(45deg); -o-box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; -moz-box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; -webkit-box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; -moz-border-radius: 2px; -webkit-border-radius: 2px; -o-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 2px\">:-)</div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The rotation was achieved by a bit of CSS3 code like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>transform: rotate(45deg);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the CSS3 2D transform spec is a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs#transform2d\">working draft standard</a> at the time of this writing, all browsers currently provide support for this only through vendor prefixed CSS3 attributes. So to make this work today you'd have to actually write all of the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-o-transform: rotate(45deg);\n-moz-transform: rotate(45deg);\n-webkit-transform: rotate(45deg);\n-ms-transform: rotate(45deg);\ntransform: rotate(45deg);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The vendor prefixes given above are for Opera, Firefox (Mozilla), WebKit based browsers (Chrome and Safari) and IE - in that order. Note that I have supplied the standard name for the attribute - \"<code>transform</code>\" - last in the list. This has been deliberately done so that when these browsers do start supporting the standard name for the attribute, that behavior (i.e., the standard behavior) will take precedence over the vendor prefixed versions by virtue of it showing up last in the rule.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from rotation, the spec also supports the specification of translation, scaling and skew transforms. Multiple transforms can be applied to a single element at the same time by separating each transform by a space. Here's another <code>div</code> that has been rotated about its center by 45 degrees and skewed along the X axis by 15 degrees.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <div style=\"text-align: center; font-style: normal; font-size: 23px; line-height: 60px; background-color: black; margin-top: 30px; width: 60px; font-family: cambria, cochin, georgia, times, serif; margin-bottom: 30px; height: 60px; color: white; font-weight: bold; -o-transform: rotate(45deg) skewx(15deg); -moz-transform: rotate(45deg) skewx(15deg); -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg) skewx(15deg); -ms-transform: rotate(45deg) skewx(15deg); transform: rotate(45deg) skewx(15deg); -o-box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; -moz-box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; -webkit-box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #0f0f0f; -moz-border-radius: 2px; -webkit-border-radius: 2px; -o-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 2px\">:-)</div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And here're the CSS3 rules that produced this output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-o-transform: rotate(45deg) skewX(15deg);\n-moz-transform: rotate(45deg) skewX(15deg);\n-webkit-transform: rotate(45deg) skewX(15deg);\n-ms-transform: rotate(45deg) skewX(15deg);\ntransform: rotate(45deg) skewX(15deg);\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"readingtransformdatabackfromtheelement\">Reading transform data back from the element</h3>\n\n<p>Now that we have the basic transform applied, let's see what we get back if we query the transform via jQuery. We use jQuery's <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/css/\"><code>css</code></a> function to retrieve the value. On IE9 for instance here's the code you'd use to get the transform:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var transform = $(\"div\").css(\"msTransform\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here's the value IE9 returns for the second <code>div</code>above (the one which has both a rotate and a skew applied):</p>\n\n<pre><code>matrix(0.707107, 0.707107, -0.517638, 0.896575, 0, 0)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can tell, that doesn't look anything like the way we specified the transform. It turns out that the browser is free to convert our transform specification into a matrix representation and discard the original string given in the style sheet. As you might expect we can also specify the transform in this format, should we choose to do so, instead of using the the syntax we used earlier. While we are reviewing matrices, it might be useful to consider the following matrix - known as the <em>identity matrix</em>. This is a transform matrix applying which produces basically no change in the source matrix - similar to the effect that multiplying a number by one produces on it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since we'll need to work with these numbers individually, it might be useful to write a helper routine that can parse a string in this form and produce an array of 6 numbers.</p>\n\n<pre><code>(function ($) {\n    //\n    // regular expression for parsing out the matrix\n    // components from the matrix string\n    //\n    var matrixRE = /\\([0-9epx\\.\\, \\t\\-]+/gi;\n\n    //\n    // parses a matrix string of the form\n    // \"matrix(n1,n2,n3,n4,n5,n6)\" and\n    // returns an array with the matrix\n    // components\n    //\n    var parseMatrix = function (val) {\n        return val.match(matrixRE)[0].substr(1).\n                  split(\",\").map(function (s) {\n            return parseFloat(s);\n        });\n    }\n})(jQuery);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We basically use a regular expression to extract the relevant portion and convert it into an array of numbers. You'll note that I've used the self-calling anonymous function technique above. This was done to prevent polluting the global namespace with variables such as <code>matrixRE</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Another factor to consider while reading transform matrix values back from the DOM is the fact that browsers today implement CSS3 2D transforms through vendor prefixes. This means that code such as the following, where we use the standard name for the CSS attribute, simply won't work!</p>\n\n<pre><code>var transform = $(\"div\").css(\"transform\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We're going to have to use the appropriate vendor prefix while setting and retrieving transform matrices from script. As this can quickly get quite cumbersome to do, it makes sense to wrap this activity up in a couple of utility routines. Here goes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(function ($) {\n    //\n    // transform css property names with vendor prefixes; the plugin\n    // will check for values in the order the names are listed here and\n    // return as soon as there is a value; so listing the W3 std name\n    // for the transform results in that being used if its available\n    //\n    var transformPropNames = [\n        \"transform\",\n        \"msTransform\",\n        \"-webkit-transform\",\n        \"-moz-transform\",\n        \"-o-transform\"\n    ];\n\n    var getTransformMatrix = function (el) {\n        //\n        // iterate through the css3 identifiers till we\n        // hit one that yields a value\n        //\n        var matrix = null;\n        transformPropNames.some(function (prop) {\n            matrix = el.css(prop);\n            return (matrix !== null &amp;&amp; matrix !== \"\");\n        });\n\n        //\n        // if \"none\" then we supplant it with an identity matrix so\n        // that our parsing code below doesn't break\n        //\n        matrix = (!matrix || matrix === \"none\") ?\n                      \"matrix(1,0,0,1,0,0)\" : matrix;\n        return parseMatrix(matrix);\n    };\n\n    //\n    // set the given matrix transform on the element; note that we\n    // apply the css transforms in reverse order of how its given\n    // in \"transformPropName\" to ensure that the std compliant prop\n    // name shows up last\n    //\n    var setTransformMatrix = function (el, matrix) {\n        var m = \"matrix(\" + matrix.join(\",\") + \")\";\n        for (var i = transformPropNames.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; --i) {\n            el.css(transformPropNames[i], m);\n        }\n    };\n})(jQuery);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With these functions handy, we can set and retrieve transforms like so and it should work well on all modern browsers:</p>\n\n<pre><code>setTransformMatrix($(\"div\"),\n   [0.707107, 0.707107, -0.517638, 0.896575, 0, 0]);\nvar matrix = getTransformMatrix($(\"div\"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"thejqueryplugin\">The jQuery plugin</h3>\n\n<p>The jQuery plugin uses jQuery's animation function to take advantage of its \"easing\" system. The animation is driven by having jQuery animate a phantom property called \"percentAnim\" from 0 through 100 on the element(s) in question and uses the \"step\" callback function to guide the actual animation of the transform matrix. Here's the source of the jQuery plugin (assuming the functions defined above are available):</p>\n\n<pre><code>(function ($) {\n    //\n    // interpolates a value between a range given a percent\n    //\n    var interpolate = function (from, to, percent) {\n        return from + ((to - from) * (percent / 100));\n    }\n\n    $.fn.transformAnimate = function (opt) {\n        //\n        // extend the options passed in by caller\n        //\n        var options = {\n            transform: \"matrix(1,0,0,1,0,0)\"\n        };\n        $.extend(options, opt);\n\n        //\n        // initialize our custom property on the element\n        // to track animation progress\n        //\n        this.css(\"percentAnim\", 0);\n\n        //\n        // supplant \"options.step\" if it exists with our own\n        // routine\n        //\n        var sourceTransform = getTransformMatrix(this);\n        var targetTransform = parseMatrix(options.transform);\n        options.step = function (percentAnim, fx) {\n            //\n            // compute the interpolated transform matrix for\n            // the current animation progress\n            //\n            var $this = $(this);\n            var matrix = sourceTransform.map(function (c, i) {\n                return interpolate(c, targetTransform[i], percentAnim);\n            });\n\n            //\n            // apply the new matrix\n            //\n            setTransformMatrix($this, matrix);\n\n            //\n            // invoke caller's version of \"step\" if one was supplied;\n            //\n            if (opt.step) {\n                opt.step.apply(this, [matrix, fx]);\n            }\n        };\n\n        //\n        // animate!\n        //\n        return this.animate({ percentAnim: 100 }, options);\n    };\n})(jQuery);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There isn't a whole lot going on there. The \"step\" function is called by jQuery every time a frame update is needed. It passes the current value of the property jQuery is animating over the given duration as an argument to the \"step\" function. In our case this will be a number that ranges between 0 and 100 and we take it as an indication of how far we are into the animation and use it to appropriately interpolate the values in the transform matrix. Here's an example of how we might use this function to translate and rotate an element over 1 second:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var box = $(\"#box\");\nbox.transformAnimate({\n    transform: \"matrix(-0.707107, 0.707107, \" +\n                 \"-0.707107, -0.707107, 150, 0)\",\n    duration: 1000\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you're wondering how I got those numbers in the matrix, well, I used the JavaScript console that ships as a part of IE9's debugging tools (just hit F12 if you're running IE) and then manually applied the said transform and then retrieved the resulting matrix via jQuery! Not exactly rocket science, I know!</p>\n\n<p>The jQuery plugin has been used to trigger an animation on the box shown below when you click on it. It uses the animation plugin defined above to translate the box 150 pixels along the X axis and also rotate it 135 degrees around the center in a clock-wise direction over 1 second and then does the reverse.

So I figured I'll just use my plugin to get it done. Turns out it isn't quite as simple as that! The problem you see is that the plugin works purely by interpolating the values of the transform matrix from the source to the target matrix over the given duration. Interpolation does not imply that things will progress in a linear fashion. For example, imagine that I wish to rotate an element from 0 degrees through 270 degrees. One can achieve this by incrementing the rotation angle from 0 to 270. However, when represented as a transform matrix it turns out that we can just as easily achieve this by rotating counter-clockwise from 0 degrees to -90 degrees! Not quite what we want! To make this kind of mindless animation work I had to put together a mini-animation framework (if you can call it that) myself.</p>\n\n<p>First, I copied the <code>setTransformMatrix</code> function from the transform jQuery plugin:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Utils = {\n    //\n    // utility for applying transform matrix\n    //\n    applyTransform: (function () {\n        var transformPropNames = [\n            \"transform\",\n            \"msTransform\",\n            \"-webkit-transform\",\n            \"-moz-transform\",\n            \"-o-transform\"\n        ];\n\n        return function (el, transform) {\n            for (var i = transformPropNames.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; --i) {\n                el.css(transformPropNames[i], transform);\n            }\n        };\n    })()\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then implemented a simple animate routine whose job is to simply invoke a callback function at a predefined interval for a specified duration.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Utils = {\n    //\n    // simple custom animation\n    //\n    animate: (function () {\n        var ANIMATION_INTERVAL = 17;\n\n        return function (duration, frame, done) {\n            var start = Date.now();\n\n            //\n            // our animation routine\n            //\n            var anim = function () {\n                //\n                // compute animation progress\n                //\n                var elapsed = (Date.now() - start);\n                var percent = elapsed / duration;\n\n                //\n                // invoke callback\n                //\n                frame(percent);\n\n                //\n                // schedule next frame update if need be\n                //\n                if (elapsed &lt; duration) {\n                    window.setTimeout(anim, ANIMATION_INTERVAL);\n                } else {\n                    done();\n                }\n            };\n\n            //\n            // schedule first frame update\n            //\n            window.setTimeout(anim, ANIMATION_INTERVAL);\n        };\n    })()\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, I put together a routine to animate the transform by animating the transform options individually, i.e., you can for instance, translate along Y axis from 10 pixels to 200 pixels and skew along X axis from 20 degrees to 0 degrees and so forth. Here's the function definition:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Utils = {\n    //\n    // wrapper for animating transforms; \"opt\" might look like this:\n    //  opt: {\n    //      scale: {\n    //          from: 0.01, to: 1.0\n    //      },\n    //      rotate: {\n    //          from: 0.0, to: 360.0 * 2.0\n    //      },\n    //      translateX: {\n    //          from: 10, to: 300\n    //      }\n    //  }\n    //\n    transformAnimate: (function () {\n        var suffix = {\n            scale: \"\",\n            scaleX: \"\",\n            scaleY: \"\",\n            rotate: \"deg\",\n            translate: \"px\",\n            translateX: \"px\",\n            translateY: \"px\",\n            skew: \"deg\",\n            skewX: \"deg\",\n            skewY: \"deg\"\n        };\n\n        return function (duration, el, opt, done) {\n            Utils.animate(duration, function (percent) {\n                var transform = \"\";\n                for (var p in opt) {\n                    var val = opt[p].from +\n                        ((opt[p].to - opt[p].from) * percent);\n                    transform += sprintf(\"%s(%f%s) \",\n                                   p, val, suffix[p]);\n                }\n                Utils.applyTransform(el, transform);\n            }, done);\n        };\n    })()\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I wanted to implement the same animation I did earlier, i.e. translate the box 150 pixels along the X axis and also rotate it 135 degrees around the center in a clock-wise direction over 1 second using this new framework, then I'd do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Utils.transformAnimate(1000, $(\"#box1\"), {\n        translateX: { from: 0.0, to: 150.0 },\n        rotate: { from: 0.0, to: 135.0 }\n}, function() {});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's another box for you that you can click to make it rotate and translate a bit.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <div style=\"text-align: center;

The best way to understand this is with an example. Here goes:\r\n\r\n    var person = Object.create({}, {\r\n        name: {\r\n            get: function() {\r\n                print(\"name.get\");\r\n                return \"foo\";\r\n            },\r\n            set: function(v) {\r\n                print(\"name.set - \" + v);\r\n            },\r\n            enumerable: true,\r\n            configurable: false\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    person.name = \"boo\";  // calls the \"set\" function above\r\n    print(person.name);   // calls the \"get\" function above\r\n\r\nWe've defined an object called \"person\" above with one property called \"name\". We've defined \"get\" and \"set\" functions which will cause the JavaScript runtime to call the respective methods whenever an attempt is made to access the property or set a value for it. This works exactly the same way as how properties work in C\\#. If you run the snippet given above here's the output we get:\r\n\r\n    name.set - boo\r\n    name.get\r\n    foo\r\n\r\nYou'll note that I really haven't actually saved the value being passed as a parameter to the \"set\" function of the \"name\" property above. In a real program you'd typically want to save this in a backing field of some sort. Now, the question is, where do we save this? One approach could be to do something like the following:\r\n\r\n    var person = Object.create({}, {\r\n        nameVal: {\r\n            value: null,\r\n            enumerable: false,\r\n            writable: true,\r\n            configurable: false\r\n        },\r\n\r\n        name: {\r\n            get: function() {\r\n                return this.nameVal;\r\n            },\r\n            set: function(v) {\r\n                this.nameVal = v;\r\n            },\r\n            enumerable: true,\r\n            configurable: false\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    person.name = \"boo\";\r\n    print(person.name);\r\n\r\nWhile this works, it does however defeat the purpose of defining separate getter and setter methods since the client of this object is anyway able to directly write to \"nameVal\". We need a mechanism of somehow hiding the backing field so that it is accessible only from the getter/setter methods and not through an object instance.\r\n\r\nEnter closures! It turns out that the descriptors for a property can actually be defined dynamically at runtime. It can be for instance, be returned from a function. We should be able to leverage this to define a self-calling function that results in the creation of a separate execution scope where the backing field for the property can be stored as a part of the closure for the scope. Again, an example should make the idea clear.\r\n\r\n    var person = Object.create({}, {\r\n        name: (function() {\r\n            var nv = \"\"; // backing store in closure\r\n\r\n            //\r\n            // the property descriptor is actually\r\n            // returned from this function\r\n            //\r\n            return {\r\n                get: function() {\r\n                    print(\"name.get\");\r\n                    return nv;\r\n                },\r\n                set: function(v) {\r\n                    print(\"name.set\");\r\n                    nv = v;\r\n                },\r\n                enumerable: true,\r\n                configurable: false\r\n            };\r\n        })()\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    person.name = \"foo\";\r\n    print(person.name);\r\n\r\nThis snippet is identical to the first example except that the property descriptor for \"name\" is being returned from an anonymous self-calling function.

Here's some lisp code:\n\n        (believe it or not but this is some lisp code!)\n\n    And here's another example with nested lists:\n\n        (lisp code (with nested lists))\n\n    If you tried entering this stuff at an [interactive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop) Lisp shell prompt however, you are bound to have been slapped with some errors and that's because even though this conforms to Lisp code structure it really doesn't mean anything. Its like trying to feed some random bit of [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) to an [XSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Stylesheet_Language) parser, or trying to pass an XSL file to the [ANT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant) program. In each of these cases, though we are passing well-formed XML they don't exactly have the tags that the respective programs are looking for.\n\n    What we have accomplished with our definition above therefore is to specify what Lisp expressions are to look like. Imagine specifying the entire XML [specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/) in one line (which of course is quite impossible because the actual spec runs to about 50 pages)! For a fully featured multi-paradigm programming language I think this is quite an incredible feat!\n\n    The technical Lisp term for what we have defined above is an *s-expression*. Any piece of valid Lisp code is always a valid s-expression but as you might have discovered if you tried getting a Lisp interpreter to parse the examples given above, not all valid s-expressions are valid Lisp code. And that is where the typical Lisp noob (such as yours truly) spends time learning the language. But as is perhaps self evident, the terseness of the basic syntax for Lisp code goes a long way in accelerating the learning process and all the apparently confounding parentheses actually end up being a rather natural way of doing things.\n\n-   The basic Lisp form is so simple that I was able to whip up a little Lisp parser in JavaScript in about half an hour!

This is akin to writing a non-validating DOM parser for XML - it simply hands you an object graph that you can programmatically traverse and do stuff with. I wrote a little HTML page to generate parse-tree visualizations given Lisp expressions of arbitrary complexity using the [Google Visualization API](http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/) and the [Organizational Chart](http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery/orgchart.html) visualization in particular. Given the following Lisp expression for instance:\n\n        (sum (gen-multiples (gen-series 1000) 3 5))\n\n    Here's the tree representation:\n\n    > ![Parse tree for Lisp expression (sum (gen-multiples (gen-series 1000) 3 5))](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/p1.png)\n\n    And for the following slightly more complex Lisp expression:\n\n        (sqrt (1+ (* (- (/ 28 2) 10) 2)))\n\n    Here's the tree representation:\n\n    > ![Parse tree for Lisp expression (sqrt (1+ (\\* (- (/ 28 2) 10) 2)))](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/p2.png)\n\n    You can try building Lisp expression trees of your own at the following location:\n\n    > [Build your own Lisp expression trees](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/arbit/webstuff/lisp-graph.html)\n\n-   Lisp s-expressions (i.e. valid Lisp form s-expressions) are of 3 types:\n\n    1.  Function calls\n    2.  Macro invocations\n    3.  Special forms\n\n    Function calls, are, well, function calls! In keeping with the minimalistic syntax philosophy, almost everything in Lisp is a function call (except of course, *macros* and *special forms*). Take for instance, arithmetic operators. In most languages, the compiler is able to natively recognize operators such as [`+ - / *`] and assign special meanings depending on the context where they are used and for that reason must, among other things, differentiate between unary, binary and ternary operators. In Lisp however, these are all function calls!\n\n    The general form of a function call is like so:\n\n        (function-name [arg1 arg2 ... argN])\n\n    As is perhaps obvious, a function call is expressed simply as a list where the first element is considered to be the function name and everything else its arguments. As always, the arguments can be Lisp s-expressions themselves. If you wanted to add 2 numbers for instance, here's what you'd do:\n\n        (+ 1 2)\n\n    Here, `+` is the name of the function being invoked and `1` and `2` are its arguments. The function `+` can accept a variable number of arguments (like the C `printf` function), which means that in order to add 4 numbers for instance, you can simply do this:\n\n        (+ 1 2 3 4)\n\n    You can build compound lists by nesting s-expressions like so:\n\n        (+ 1 2 (+ 3 4))\n\n    Lisp will always evaluate the function arguments first from left to right (evaluating nested s-expressions if any) and only then invoke the function with the result of evaluating the argument forms. In the example above therefore, it will evaluate `1` and `2` first - which evaluate to themselves, i.e. `1` and `2` - followed by `(+ 3 4)` - which evaluates to `7`. The resulting 3 numbers (`1`, `2` and `7`) are then passed to `+` which evaluates the composite expression to the value `10`.\n\nThere's a lot more that one can say about functions. I'll cover some of it in a subsequent post and also talk a bit about *macros* (which while a rather unique feature of Lisp is also at the same time quite powerful) and *special forms*.","html":"<p>I have covered about 4 chapters from the book <a href=\"http://gigamonkeys.com/book/\">Practical Common Lisp</a> and what I have learnt so far is quite fascinating to say the least.

I figured I'd implement an *automatic memoization* mechanism in JavaScript that will work well under certain well defined constraints.

If you wished to write a *memoized* version of the function here's what you'd do:\r\n\r\n    var fac = memoize( function( n ) {\r\n        if( n <= 0 )\r\n            return 1;\r\n        return ( n * fac( n - 1 ) );\r\n    } );\r\n\r\nIf you invoked `fac` passing `5` for instance, and traced the control flow, here's the sequence of calls you'd see:\r\n\r\n    . __fn(5)\r\n    .. fac(5)\r\n    ... __fn(4)\r\n    .... fac(4)\r\n    ..... __fn(3)\r\n    ...... fac(3)\r\n    ....... __fn(2)\r\n    ........ fac(2)\r\n    ......... __fn(1)\r\n    .......... fac(1)\r\n    ........... __fn(0)\r\n    ............ fac(0)\r\n\r\nThe number of dots to the left of the function names indicates the stack depth and here it tends to increase because `fac` is a recursive function and keeps calling itself till the termination criteria is met. This seems like a drawback since where you'd have had a sequence of calls to just `fac` now we see it interspersed with calls to `__fn` also, effectively doubling the number of function calls that needs to be made. The benefit however, is realized when we observe what happens when `fac` is invoked again, a second time, passing `5`.\r\n\r\n    . __fn(5)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this time around, there was only a single function call. No further computation was needed as the required result was already available in the cache and only a simple look-up operation was performed. Observe what happens when we pass `3` next.\r\n\r\n    . __fn(3)\r\n\r\nThis was resolved via cache look-up also because the first call with `5` had recursively invoked `fac` with `3` as well. On a similar note, passing `7` produces the following call sequence:\r\n\r\n    . __fn(7)\r\n    .. fac(7)\r\n    ... __fn(6)\r\n    .... fac(6)\r\n    ..... __fn(5)\r\n\r\nAutomatic memoization ensures that the original routine is called only the bare minimum number of times - in this case, for the values `7` and `6`. The implementation of `memoize` given above is useful only so long as the following are held true:\r\n\r\n1.  Each parameter passed to the actual function has a `toString` method that returns a meaningful value; if you passed a custom object for instance, you're going to have to define a `toString` method on it.\r\n2.  The CPU overhead of constructing a unique key for a given parameter set and doing hashtable lookups should be lower (preferably *significantly*) than simply performing the actual work.\r\n3.  For obvious reasons, the function should have at least 1 parameter!\r\n\r\nIf you've been following this blog, you know that I am trying to learn the [*Common Lisp*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp) programming language. I figured, I'll try and implement `memoize` in *Common Lisp* as well, to see if I'd learned enough of it to be able to do this. After looking up the [Common Lisp Hyperspec](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/) a few times, I was in fact able to come up with an implementation that does essentially the same thing as what the JavaScript version above does. Here goes:\r\n\r\n    (defun make-key (lst)\r\n      (format nil \"~{~A-~}\" lst))\r\n\r\n    (defun memoize (fn)\r\n      (let ((cache (make-hash-table :test 'equal)))\r\n        #'(lambda (&rest p)\r\n        (let ((key (make-key p)))\r\n          (if (not (gethash key cache))\r\n            (setf (gethash key cache) (apply fn p)))\r\n          (gethash key cache)))))\r\n\r\n    (setf fac (memoize #'(lambda (n)\r\n                            (if (<= n 0) 1\r\n                                (* n (funcall fac (- n 1)))))))\r\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization\">Memoization</a> is an optimization technique where the idea is to create functions that cache computed values for various input sets so that subsequent invocations can return the value from the cache instead of re-computing the results.

If you wished to write a <em>memoized</em> version of the function here's what you'd do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var fac = memoize( function( n ) {\n    if( n &lt;= 0 )\n        return 1;\n    return ( n * fac( n - 1 ) );\n} );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you invoked <code>fac</code> passing <code>5</code> for instance, and traced the control flow, here's the sequence of calls you'd see:</p>\n\n<pre><code>. __fn(5)\n.. fac(5)\n... __fn(4)\n.... fac(4)\n..... __fn(3)\n...... fac(3)\n....... __fn(2)\n........ fac(2)\n......... __fn(1)\n.......... fac(1)\n........... __fn(0)\n............ fac(0)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The number of dots to the left of the function names indicates the stack depth and here it tends to increase because <code>fac</code> is a recursive function and keeps calling itself till the termination criteria is met. This seems like a drawback since where you'd have had a sequence of calls to just <code>fac</code> now we see it interspersed with calls to <code>__fn</code> also, effectively doubling the number of function calls that needs to be made. The benefit however, is realized when we observe what happens when <code>fac</code> is invoked again, a second time, passing <code>5</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>. __fn(5)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, this time around, there was only a single function call. No further computation was needed as the required result was already available in the cache and only a simple look-up operation was performed. Observe what happens when we pass <code>3</code> next.</p>\n\n<pre><code>. __fn(3)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This was resolved via cache look-up also because the first call with <code>5</code> had recursively invoked <code>fac</code> with <code>3</code> as well. On a similar note, passing <code>7</code> produces the following call sequence:</p>\n\n<pre><code>. __fn(7)\n.. fac(7)\n... __fn(6)\n.... fac(6)\n..... __fn(5)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Automatic memoization ensures that the original routine is called only the bare minimum number of times - in this case, for the values <code>7</code> and <code>6</code>. The implementation of <code>memoize</code> given above is useful only so long as the following are held true:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Each parameter passed to the actual function has a <code>toString</code> method that returns a meaningful value; if you passed a custom object for instance, you're going to have to define a <code>toString</code> method on it.  </li>\n<li>The CPU overhead of constructing a unique key for a given parameter set and doing hashtable lookups should be lower (preferably <em>significantly</em>) than simply performing the actual work.  </li>\n<li>For obvious reasons, the function should have at least 1 parameter!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you've been following this blog, you know that I am trying to learn the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp\"><em>Common Lisp</em></a> programming language. I figured, I'll try and implement <code>memoize</code> in <em>Common Lisp</em> as well, to see if I'd learned enough of it to be able to do this. After looking up the <a href=\"http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/\">Common Lisp Hyperspec</a> a few times, I was in fact able to come up with an implementation that does essentially the same thing as what the JavaScript version above does. Here goes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(defun make-key (lst)\n  (format nil \"~{~A-~}\" lst))\n\n(defun memoize (fn)\n  (let ((cache (make-hash-table :test 'equal)))\n    #'(lambda (&amp;rest p)\n    (let ((key (make-key p)))\n      (if (not (gethash key cache))\n        (setf (gethash key cache) (apply fn p)))\n      (gethash key cache)))))\n\n(setf fac (memoize #'(lambda (n)\n                        (if (&lt;= n 0) 1\n                            (* n (funcall fac (- n 1)))))))\n</code></pre>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1249022074637,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1249022074637,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1249022074637,"published_by":1},{"id":61,"uuid":"897ac4da-16c5-4e6e-957e-45dc966ffc1c","title":"Web Camps, Virtual Tech Days and jsFoo","slug":"webcampsvirtualtechdaysandjsfo","markdown":"So I've had a busy few weeks recently doing a bunch of sessions at [Web Camps](http://bit.ly/r56sCs) (in Delhi and Hyderabad), [Virtual Tech Days](http://bit.ly/qgtuFu) and [jsFoo](http://jsfoo.hasgeek.com/).

Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    function acc( n ) {\r\n        return function( i ) {\r\n            return n += i;\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var fn = acc( 5 );\r\n    var n1 = fn( 1 );\r\n    var n2 = fn( 2 );\r\n\r\n    var fn2 = acc( 10 );\r\n    var n3 = fn2( 1 );\r\n    var n4 = fn2( 2 );\r\n\r\nHere, `n3` and `n4` hold `11` and `13` respectively. The function `fn` has no effect whatsoever on `fn2` (or vice versa). This in fact, is the basis for creating the C++ equivalent of *private* member data in JavaScript. Imagine that you wish to create the equivalent of the .NET [StringBuilder](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.stringbuilder.aspx) class and want to make the buffer where the string is actually stored a private member of the class. If you did this:\r\n\r\n    function StringBuilder() {\r\n        this.buffer = [];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen `buffer` is a *public* member and can be accessed via an instance. To make it private, simply declare `buffer` as a local variable inside `StringBuilder`. Like this:\r\n\r\n    function StringBuilder() {\r\n        var buffer = [];\r\n        \r\n        this.getBuffer = function() {\r\n            //\r\n            // TODO:\r\n            // return a copy so the original buffer is\r\n            // left intact\r\n            //\r\n            return buffer;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow `buffer` is not visible to routines defined outside `StringBuilder` via an instance.

If you've never heard of ECMAScript, well, don't feel too bad as it is better known, used, loved (and hated) by its other name - *JavaScript*. As far as names go *JavaScript* is probably not a whole lot better than *ECMAScript* either - as [Douglas Crockford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford) so eloquently (half joking actually) put it in a [recent session](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX11/RES02) that he did during Microsoft's [MIX](http://visitmix.com/) event:\n\n> \"*Maybe it's time to change the name of it. Because if it isn't Java and if it isn't script then the name is completely wrong!*\"\n\nDouglas was actually responding to a comment from [Allen Wirfs-Brock](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/allen+wirfs-brock) that JavaScript really isn't a \"scripting\" language if you think of scripting languages as being programming languages that are somewhat limited in capabilities or are designed to be used with very specific use cases in mind. JavaScript is a full-fledged general purpose programming language that is [turing complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) which has been used with great success in contexts other than the browser with the [node.js](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodejs) project perhaps being the most renowned. It kind of goes to show how things might end up being given names that have little to do with the thing that is being named!\n\nSo then, ECMAScript version 5 (referred to as **ES5** henceforth) brings a nifty set of features designed, among other things, to introduce an element of discipline to JavaScript development. As far as being a dynamic language is concerned, JavaScript is about as dynamic as a language could probably get! While that dynamism grants considerable expressive power, it also makes it rather trivial to write incorrect code. Consider the following snippet for instance (**Note**: I have used the [JavaScript Eval Console](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-JavaScriptevalconsole.aspx) for testing all of the code given below; so when you see calls to functions such as `print` and `sprintf` please understand that those are functions provided by the console; please read that post to see what those functions do if it isn't clear from the context):\n\n    var data = [\n        {\n            month: 1,\n            revenue: 102010,\n            expense: 95000\n        },\n        \n        {\n            month: 2,\n            revenue: 143232,\n            expense: 98000\n        },\n        \n        {\n            month: 3,\n            revenue: 323212,\n            expense: 195000\n        }\n    ];\n\n    function Results() {\n        this.totalRevenue = 0;\n        this.totalExpense = 0;\n        this.netProfit = 0;\n    }\n\n    var r = new Results();\n\n    //\n    // iterate through the data set and compute total\n    // revenue and expense\n    //\n    data.forEach(function(d) {\n        r.totalrevenue += d.revenue;\n        r.totalExpense += d.expense;\n    });\n\n    //\n    // net profit is revenue - expense\n    //\n    r.netProfit = r.totalRevenue - r.totalExpense;\n    print(r.netProfit);\n\nHere's the output we get.\n\n    -388000\n\nClearly, something is not right here because when you look at the data the revenue exceeds expenses for every single month - so we really shouldn't be ending up with a net loss. Let's take a closer look at the code that's iterating through the array and computing total revenue and expense. Pay particular attention to the part highlighted in bold:\n\n    data.forEach(function(d) {\n        r.totalrevenue += d.revenue;\n        r.totalExpense += d.expense;\n    });\n\nAs you can see, there's a typo there. The 'r' in `totalrevenue` should have been upper case. Instead of flagging that as an error the JavaScript engine just went right ahead and created a new property on the `Results` instance with a lower case 'r'. This of course messed up the net profit computation later on. Wouldn't it be nice if we could somehow prevent the arbitrary creation of new members on objects? It is precisely for situations such as this that the ES5 spec includes a slew of new methods (well, three of them at least) on the `Object` type that allow you to exercise greater control on the extensibility aspects of your objects. Let's review what they are and what they do.\n\n### Object.preventExtensions\n\n`Object.preventExtensions` does exactly what it sounds like it would do - it prevents arbitrary properties from being tacked on to the object in question. Here's an example:\n\n    var o = {};\n\n    o.newFangledProperty1 = \"zoo\";\n    print(typeof(o.newFangledProperty1));\n\n    Object.preventExtensions(o);\n\n    o.newFangledProperty2 = \"moo\";\n    print(typeof(o.newFangledProperty2));\n\nAnd here's the output we get:\n\n    string\n    undefined\n\nAs is evident from the output, the attempt to create `newFangledProperty2` was not successful. The JavaScript engine silently ignored the creation of the new property and it did this because we marked the object as *permanently* non-extensible by calling `Object.preventExtensions` on it. You can verify whether an object is extensible or not by calling `Object.isExtensible` on it which would return a boolean indicating `true` if it is extensible and `false` otherwise.\n\n    print(Object.isExtensible(o));\n\nOutput:\n\n    false\n\nWe can easily use this method on our `Results` object above to prevent the creation of arbitrary properties on it like so:\n\n    var r = new Results();\n    Object.preventExtensions(r);\n\nNow the line with the typo will end up being a no-op statement having no effect on the object. The result will still be wrong of course since the `totalRevenue` property will continue to have the value zero. So what's the point of using `preventExtensions` you might wonder. In scenarios such as this, using `Object.preventExtensions` makes the most sense when used in tandem with ES5's support for \"[strict mode](http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/)\". ES5's \"strict mode\" is a new feature that causes the JavaScript engine to interpret the relevant section of code (i.e. the part that you have marked as being strict) with a stricter set of rules than what is allowed in ES3. One of the consequences of switching the engine into strict mode is that it'll throw more errors in situations where it would otherwise have simply silently failed/ignored the error. Assigning an arbitrary property to an object that has been marked as not being extensible via `preventExtensions` for instance causes an exception to be thrown. Here's the updated profit computation snippet using strict mode and `preventExtensions`. Take note of the lines highlighted in bold.\n\n    \"use strict\"; // make engine switch into strict mode\n        \n    var data = [\n        {\n            month: 1,\n            revenue: 102010,\n            expense: 95000\n        },\n        \n        {\n            month: 2,\n            revenue: 143232,\n            expense: 98000\n        },\n        \n        {\n            month: 3,\n            revenue: 323212,\n            expense: 195000\n        }\n    ];\n\n    function Results() {\n        this.totalRevenue = 0;\n        this.totalExpense = 0;\n        this.netProfit = 0;\n    }\n\n    var r = new Results();\n    Object.preventExtensions(r); // disallow arbitrary extensibility\n\n    //\n    // iterate through the data set and compute total\n    // revenue and expense\n    //\n    data.forEach(function(d) {\n        r.totalrevenue += d.revenue;\n        r.totalExpense += d.expense;\n    });\n\n    //\n    // net profit is revenue - expense\n    //\n    r.netProfit = r.totalRevenue - r.totalExpense;\n    print(r.netProfit);\n\nAnd here's the output we get on running the script in a browser that can understand strict modes ([IE10 Platform Preview 1](http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/info/downloads/Default.html) in this case; but recent versions of Chrome, FireFox, Safari and Opera should be able to handle it as well).\n\n    Cannot create property for a non-extensible object\n\nAs you can tell, an exception was thrown upon encountering the line where an attempt was made to create a new property on the object `r`.\n\n### Object.seal\n\n`Object.seal` is a superset of `Object.preventExtensions` in functionality in that while it prevents tacking on of arbitrary properties to objects it also prevents altering the attributes of the properties that already exist on the object. Also, it disallows deleting properties. First we'll define a little helper function that will allow us to enumerate and print all the \"own\" properties (i.e. properties defined directly on the object instead of its prototype) that are present on a given object which we'll use to examine the object's property state as we go along.\n\n    //\n    // prints the property descriptors for all the \"own\"\n    // properties on the object \"o\"\n    //\n    function printDesc(o) {\n        Object.getOwnPropertyNames(o).forEach(function(p) {\n            print(sprintf(\"%s: %s\", p,\n                JSON.stringify(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(o, p),\n                null, \" \")));\n        });\n    }\n\nWith this function in hand let's go ahead and define a simple object with a single property called \"name\" using `Object.defineProperty` and print it to the console via `printDesc`.\n\n    //\n    // define object with one property\n    //\n    var person = {};\n    Object.defineProperty(person, \"name\", {\n        value: \"no name\",\n        writable: true,\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    print(\"Default state:\");\n    printDesc(person);\n\nHere's the output we get on running this:\n\n    Default state:\n    name: {\n      \"value\": \"no name\",\n      \"writable\": true,\n      \"enumerable\": true,\n      \"configurable\": true\n    }\n\nLet's next examine the effect calling `Object.preventExtensions` has on the attribute state:\n\n    //\n    // prevent extensions\n    //\n    Object.preventExtensions(person);\n    print(\"preventExtensions:\");\n    printDesc(person);\n\nOutput:\n\n    preventExtensions:\n    name: {\n      \"value\": \"no name\",\n      \"writable\": true,\n      \"enumerable\": true,\n      \"configurable\": true\n    }\n\nAs you can tell nothing at all has changed on the attributes of the property `name`. This makes sense as the only effect that `preventExtensions` has on the object is to make it non-extensible. Let's next attempt to edit the property descriptor for the property `name` and see what happens:\n\n    //\n    // manually change property descriptor\n    //\n    Object.defineProperty(person, \"name\", {\n        value: \"no name\",\n        writable: false,    // make property read only\n        enumerable: false,  // disallow enumeration\n        configurable: true  // allow editing prop descriptor\n    });\n    print(\"Manual config reset:\");\n    printDesc(person);\n\nOutput:\n\n    Manual config reset:\n    name: {\n      \"value\": \"no name\",\n      \"writable\": false,\n      \"enumerable\": false,\n      \"configurable\": true\n    }\n\nSo far everything seems to be working as expected. Let's continue the experiment and `seal` the object and see what happens.\n\n    //\n    // seal\n    //\n    Object.seal(person);\n    print(\"seal:\");\n    printDesc(person);\n\nOutput:\n\n    seal:\n    name: {\n      \"value\": \"no name\",\n      \"writable\": false,\n      \"enumerable\": false,\n      \"configurable\": false <-- this changed!\n    }\n\nSealing the object seems to have had the effect of setting the `configurable` attribute on the property descriptor to `false`. So what happens when we attempt to delete a property or tack on a new property?\n\n    //\n    // delete property \"name\"\n    // add a new property\n    //\n    delete person.name;\n    person.age = 10;\n    print(\"Delete/add properties:\");\n    printDesc(person);\n\nOutput:\n\n    Delete/add properties:\n    name: {\n      \"value\": \"no name\",\n      \"writable\": false,\n      \"enumerable\": false,\n      \"configurable\": false\n    }\n\nAs you can tell, nothing happened! Calling `Object.seal` on `person` causes the JavaScript engine to ignore \"delete\" calls and attempts to introduce new properties. In strict mode both of these attempts would have caused an error to be thrown. Finally, let's try and redefine the property descriptor on the sealed instance of `person` and see what happens.\n\n    //\n    // manually change property descriptor again\n    //\n    Object.defineProperty(person, \"name\", {\n        value: \"no name\",\n        writable: true,\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurble: true\n    });\n    print(\"Second manual config reset:\");\n    printDesc(person);\n\nOutput:\n\n    Cannot redefine non-configurable property 'name'\n\nThe JavaScript engine throws an error indicating that this operation is not allowed on a sealed object. Note that this error is thrown even when we are *not* running in strict mode. You can check if an object has been sealed by calling `Object.isSealed` which returns `true` if the object has been sealed and `false` otherwise.\n\n### Object.freeze\n\n`Object.freeze` is a superset of both `Object.seal` and `Object.preventExtensions` in that it subsumes the functionality of both of those functions with the added responsibility of making all of the existing properties on the object read-only. Here's an example:\n\n    var ShapeType = {\n        None: 0,\n        Line: 1,\n        Ellipse: 2,\n        Rectangle: 3,\n        RoundedRectangle: 4\n    };\n\n    Object.freeze(ShapeType);\n\n    ShapeType.None = 5;\n    print(ShapeType.None);\n\n    ShapeType.Polygon = 5;\n    print(typeof(ShapeType.Polygon));\n\nOutput:\n\n    0\n    undefined\n\nOnce an object has been frozen attempts to assign a value to an existing property or to define a new property are silently ignored in normal mode. In strict mode this would cause the engine to throw an error. To determine if an object has been frozen call `Object.isFrozen`.\n\nHere's a table that summarizes the functionalities of `preventExtensions`, `seal` and `freeze` taken from [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff806186(v=VS.94).aspx):\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Function</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Object made non-extensible?</th>\n<th align=\"left\">&quot;configurable&quot; set to false for all properties?</th>\n<th align=\"left\">&quot;writable&quot; set to false for all properties?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><code>Object.preventExtensions</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">No</td>\n<td align=\"left\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><code>Object.seal</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><code>Object.freeze</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nIn summary therefore, `preventExtensions`, `seal` and `freeze` allow you to exercise very precise control on how extensible or modifiable your objects are going to be. In combination with \"strict mode\" these new enhancements to JavaScript should help developers catch errors much earlier in the development cycle. And the fact that these capabilities are provided through new methods on the `Object` type should make it trivial to gracefully degrade when your site runs on older browsers that do not have support for ES5 features. In short there's no reason why you should not start using these features in your web apps from, like, right now!\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript\">ECMAScript</a> version 5 is the latest, official, approved standard version of the <em>ECMAScript</em> programming language. If you've never heard of ECMAScript, well, don't feel too bad as it is better known, used, loved (and hated) by its other name - <em>JavaScript</em>. As far as names go <em>JavaScript</em> is probably not a whole lot better than <em>ECMAScript</em> either - as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford\">Douglas Crockford</a> so eloquently (half joking actually) put it in a <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX11/RES02\">recent session</a> that he did during Microsoft's <a href=\"http://visitmix.com/\">MIX</a> event:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"<em>Maybe it's time to change the name of it. Because if it isn't Java and if it isn't script then the name is completely wrong!</em>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Douglas was actually responding to a comment from <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/allen+wirfs-brock\">Allen Wirfs-Brock</a> that JavaScript really isn't a \"scripting\" language if you think of scripting languages as being programming languages that are somewhat limited in capabilities or are designed to be used with very specific use cases in mind. JavaScript is a full-fledged general purpose programming language that is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness\">turing complete</a> which has been used with great success in contexts other than the browser with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodejs\">node.js</a> project perhaps being the most renowned. It kind of goes to show how things might end up being given names that have little to do with the thing that is being named!</p>\n\n<p>So then, ECMAScript version 5 (referred to as <strong>ES5</strong> henceforth) brings a nifty set of features designed, among other things, to introduce an element of discipline to JavaScript development. As far as being a dynamic language is concerned, JavaScript is about as dynamic as a language could probably get! While that dynamism grants considerable expressive power, it also makes it rather trivial to write incorrect code. Consider the following snippet for instance (<strong>Note</strong>: I have used the <a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-JavaScriptevalconsole.aspx\">JavaScript Eval Console</a> for testing all of the code given below; so when you see calls to functions such as <code>print</code> and <code>sprintf</code> please understand that those are functions provided by the console; please read that post to see what those functions do if it isn't clear from the context):</p>\n\n<pre><code>var data = [\n    {\n        month: 1,\n        revenue: 102010,\n        expense: 95000\n    },\n\n    {\n        month: 2,\n        revenue: 143232,\n        expense: 98000\n    },\n\n    {\n        month: 3,\n        revenue: 323212,\n        expense: 195000\n    }\n];\n\nfunction Results() {\n    this.totalRevenue = 0;\n    this.totalExpense = 0;\n    this.netProfit = 0;\n}\n\nvar r = new Results();\n\n//\n// iterate through the data set and compute total\n// revenue and expense\n//\ndata.forEach(function(d) {\n    r.totalrevenue += d.revenue;\n    r.totalExpense += d.expense;\n});\n\n//\n// net profit is revenue - expense\n//\nr.netProfit = r.totalRevenue - r.totalExpense;\nprint(r.netProfit);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's the output we get.</p>\n\n<pre><code>-388000\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Clearly, something is not right here because when you look at the data the revenue exceeds expenses for every single month - so we really shouldn't be ending up with a net loss.

Let's continue the experiment and <code>seal</code> the object and see what happens.</p>\n\n<pre><code>//\n// seal\n//\nObject.seal(person);\nprint(\"seal:\");\nprintDesc(person);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>seal:\nname: {\n  \"value\": \"no name\",\n  \"writable\": false,\n  \"enumerable\": false,\n  \"configurable\": false &lt;-- this changed!\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sealing the object seems to have had the effect of setting the <code>configurable</code> attribute on the property descriptor to <code>false</code>. So what happens when we attempt to delete a property or tack on a new property?</p>\n\n<pre><code>//\n// delete property \"name\"\n// add a new property\n//\ndelete person.name;\nperson.age = 10;\nprint(\"Delete/add properties:\");\nprintDesc(person);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Delete/add properties:\nname: {\n  \"value\": \"no name\",\n  \"writable\": false,\n  \"enumerable\": false,\n  \"configurable\": false\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can tell, nothing happened! Calling <code>Object.seal</code> on <code>person</code> causes the JavaScript engine to ignore \"delete\" calls and attempts to introduce new properties. In strict mode both of these attempts would have caused an error to be thrown. Finally, let's try and redefine the property descriptor on the sealed instance of <code>person</code> and see what happens.</p>\n\n<pre><code>//\n// manually change property descriptor again\n//\nObject.defineProperty(person, \"name\", {\n    value: \"no name\",\n    writable: true,\n    enumerable: true,\n    configurble: true\n});\nprint(\"Second manual config reset:\");\nprintDesc(person);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Cannot redefine non-configurable property 'name'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The JavaScript engine throws an error indicating that this operation is not allowed on a sealed object. Note that this error is thrown even when we are <em>not</em> running in strict mode. You can check if an object has been sealed by calling <code>Object.isSealed</code> which returns <code>true</code> if the object has been sealed and <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"objectfreeze\">Object.freeze</h3>\n\n<p><code>Object.freeze</code> is a superset of both <code>Object.seal</code> and <code>Object.preventExtensions</code> in that it subsumes the functionality of both of those functions with the added responsibility of making all of the existing properties on the object read-only. Here's an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var ShapeType = {\n    None: 0,\n    Line: 1,\n    Ellipse: 2,\n    Rectangle: 3,\n    RoundedRectangle: 4\n};\n\nObject.freeze(ShapeType);\n\nShapeType.None = 5;\nprint(ShapeType.None);\n\nShapeType.Polygon = 5;\nprint(typeof(ShapeType.Polygon));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0\nundefined\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once an object has been frozen attempts to assign a value to an existing property or to define a new property are silently ignored in normal mode. In strict mode this would cause the engine to throw an error. To determine if an object has been frozen call <code>Object.isFrozen</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a table that summarizes the functionalities of <code>preventExtensions</code>, <code>seal</code> and <code>freeze</code> taken from <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff806186(v=VS.94).aspx\">MSDN</a>:</p>\n\n<table>  \n<thead>  \n<tr class=\"header\">  \n<th align=\"left\">Function</th>  \n<th align=\"left\">Object made non-extensible?</th>  \n<th align=\"left\">&quot;configurable&quot; set to false for all properties?</th>  \n<th align=\"left\">&quot;writable&quot; set to false for all properties?</th>  \n</tr>  \n</thead>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr class=\"odd\">  \n<td align=\"left\"><code>Object.preventExtensions</code></td>  \n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>  \n<td align=\"left\">No</td>  \n<td align=\"left\">No</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr class=\"even\">  \n<td align=\"left\"><code>Object.seal</code></td>  \n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>  \n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>  \n<td align=\"left\">No</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr class=\"odd\">  \n<td align=\"left\"><code>Object.freeze</code></td>  \n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>  \n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>  \n<td align=\"left\">Yes</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>\n\n<p>In summary therefore, <code>preventExtensions</code>, <code>seal</code> and <code>freeze</code> allow you to exercise very precise control on how extensible or modifiable your objects are going to be. In combination with \"strict mode\" these new enhancements to JavaScript should help developers catch errors much earlier in the development cycle. And the fact that these capabilities are provided through new methods on the <code>Object</code> type should make it trivial to gracefully degrade when your site runs on older browsers that do not have support for ES5 features. In short there's no reason why you should not start using these features in your web apps from, like, right now!</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1303616643477,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1398012968334,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1303616643477,"published_by":1},{"id":64,"uuid":"32ea3011-b769-4576-a389-c3be54950d10","title":"What's wrong with India?","slug":"whatswrongwithindia","markdown":"There was a small article writing contest in the [company](http://www.virtusa.com/) that I work for to commemorate the 59<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Indian independence.

Let's next take a look at retrieving records from the database. Surprisingly, this turns out to be a bit complex. The indexed DB way of enumerating records from an object store is to use a \"cursor\" object. A cursor can iterate over records from an underlying object store or an index. A cursor has the following key properties:\r\n\r\n1.  A ***range*** of records in either an index or an object store.\r\n2.  A ***source*** that references the index or object store that the cursor is iterating over.\r\n3.  A ***position*** indicating the current position of the cursor in the given range of records.\r\n\r\nWhile the concept of a cursor is fairly straightforward, writing the code to actually iterate over an object store turns out to be somewhat tricky given the asynchronous nature of all the API calls.

In this installment we'll take a look at some of the other bits such as how drag/drop, File API, Canvas and Web Workers are used.\n\n### Drag/Drop\n\nOne of the things that *InstaFuzz* supports is the ability to drag and drop image files directly on to the big blackish/blue box. Support for this is enabled by handling the \"drop\" event on the CANVAS element. When a file is dropped onto an HTML element the browser fires the \"drop\" event on that element and passes in a [*dataTransfer*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/ms535861.aspx) object which contains a [*files*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ie/hh772716.aspx) property that contains a reference to the list of files that were dropped. Here's how this is handled in the app (\"picture\" is the ID of the CANVAS element on the page):\n\n    var pic = $(\"#picture\");\n    pic.bind(\"drop\", function (e) {\n        suppressEvent(e);\n        var files = e.originalEvent.dataTransfer.files;\n        // more code here to open the file\n    });\n    pic.bind(\"dragover\", suppressEvent).bind(\"dragenter\", suppressEvent);\n    function suppressEvent(e) {\n        e.stopPropagation();\n        e.preventDefault();\n    }\n\nThe *files* property is a collection of [*File*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ie/hh772305.aspx) objects that can then subsequently be used with the File API to access the file contents (covered in the next section). We also handle the *dragover* and *dragenter* events and basically prevent those events from propagating to the browser thereby preventing the browser from handling the file drop. IE for instance might unload the current page and attempt to open the file directly otherwise.\n\n### File API\n\nOnce the file has been dropped, the app attempts to open the image and render it in the canvas. It does this by using the [File API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673542(v=vs.85).aspx). The File API is a W3C specification that allows web apps to programmatically access files from the local file system in a secure fashion. In *InstaFuzz* we use the [*FileReader*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772310(v=vs.85).aspx) object to read the file contents as a [data URL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/cc848897.aspx) string like so using the [*readAsDataURL*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772313(v=vs.85).aspx) method:\n\n    var reader = new FileReader();\n    reader.onloadend = function (e2) {\n        drawImageToCanvas(e2.target.result);\n    };\n    reader.readAsDataURL(files[0]);\n\nHere, *files* is the collection of *File* objects retrieved from the function handling the \"drop\" event on the CANVAS element. Since we are interested only in a single file we simply pick the first file from the collection and ignore the rest if there are any. The actual file contents are loaded asynchronously and once the load completes, the [*onloadend*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772337(v=vs.85).aspx) event is fired where we get the file contents as a data URL which we then subsequently draw on to the canvas.\n\n### Rendering the filters\n\nNow the core functionality here is of course the application of the filters. In order to be able to apply the filter to the image we need a way to access the individual pixels from the image. And before we can access the pixels we need to have actually rendered the image on to our canvas. So let's first take a look at the code that renders the image that the user picked on to the canvas element.\n\n#### Rendering images on to the canvas\n\nThe canvas element supports the rendering of *Image* objects via the [*drawImage*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff975414(v=vs.85).aspx) method. To load up the image file in an *Image* instance, *InstaFuzz* uses the following utility routine:\n\n    App.Namespace.define(\"InstaFuzz.Utils\", {\n        loadImage: function (url, complete) {\n            var img = new Image();\n            img.src = url;\n            img.onload = function () {\n                complete(img);\n            };\n        }\n    });\n\nThis allows the app to load up image objects from a URL using code such as the following:\n\n    function drawImageToCanvas(url) {\n        InstaFuzz.Utils.loadImage(url, function (img) {\n            // save reference to source image\n            sourceImage = img;\n\n            mainRenderer.clearCanvas();\n            mainRenderer.renderImage(img);\n\n            // load image filter previews\n            loadPreviews(img);\n        });\n    }\n\nHere, *mainRenderer* is an instance created from the *FilterRenderer* constructor function defined in *filter-renderer.js*. The app uses *FilterRenderer* objects to manage canvas elements - both in the preview pane as well as the main canvas element on the right. The *renderImage* method on the *FilterRenderer* has been defined like so:\n\n    FilterRenderer.prototype.renderImage = function (img) {\n        var imageWidth = img.width;\n        var imageHeight = img.height;\n        var canvasWidth = this.size.width;\n        var canvasHeight = this.size.height;\n        var width, height;\n\n        if ((imageWidth / imageHeight) >= (canvasWidth / canvasHeight)) {\n            width = canvasWidth;\n            height = (imageHeight * canvasWidth / imageWidth);\n        } else {\n            width = (imageWidth * canvasHeight / imageHeight);\n            height = canvasHeight;\n        }\n\n        var x = (canvasWidth - width) / 2;\n        var y = (canvasHeight - height) / 2;\n        this.context.drawImage(img, x, y, width, height);\n    };\n\nThat might seem like a lot of code but all it does ultimately is to figure out the best way to render the image in the available screen area considering the aspect ratio of the image. The key piece of code that actually renders the image on the canvas occurs on the last line of the method. The *context* member refers to the 2D context acquired from the canvas object by calling its [*getContext*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff975238(v=vs.85).aspx) method.\n\n#### Fetching pixels from the canvas\n\nNow that the image has been rendered we will need access to the individual pixels in order to apply all the different filters that are available. This is easily acquired by calling [*getImageData*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff975418(v=vs.85).aspx) on the canvas's context object. Here's how *InstaFuzz* calls this from *instafuzz.js*.\n\n    var imageData = renderer.context.getImageData(\n        0, 0,\n        renderer.size.width,\n        renderer.size.height);\n\nThe object returned by *getImageData* provides access to the individual pixels via its *data* property which in turn is an array like object that contains a collection of byte values where each value represents the color rendered for a single channel of a single pixel. Each pixel is represented using 4 bytes that specify values for the red, green, blue and alpha channels. It also has a [*length*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff974921(v=vs.85).aspx) property that returns the length of the buffer. If you have a 2D co-ordinate you can easily transform that into an index into this array using code such as the following. The color intensity values of each channel ranges from 0 through 255. Here's the utility function from *filters.js* that accepts as input an image data object along with 2D coordinates for the pixel the caller is interested in and returns an object containing the color values:\n\n    function getPixel(imageData, x, y) {\n        var data = imageData.data, index = 0;\n\n        // normalize x and y and compute index\n        x = (x < 0) ? (imageData.width + x) : x;\n        y = (y < 0) ? (imageData.height + y) : y;\n        index = (x + y * imageData.width) * 4;\n\n        return {\n            r: data[index],\n            g: data[index + 1],\n            b: data[index + 2]\n        };\n    }\n\n#### Applying the filters\n\nNow that we have access to the individual pixels, applying the filter is fairly straightforward. Here, for instance is the function that applies a weighted grayscale filter on the image. It simply picks intensities from the red, green and blue channels and sums them up after applying a multiplication factor on each channel and then assigns the result for all 3 channels.\n\n    // \"Weighted Grayscale\" filter\n    Filters.addFilter({\n        name: \"Weighted Grayscale\",\n        apply: function (imageData) {\n            var w = imageData.width, h = imageData.height;\n            var data = imageData.data;\n            var index;\n            for (var y = 0; y < h; ++y) {\n                for (var x = 0; x < w; ++x) {\n                    index = (x + y * imageData.width) * 4;\n                    var luminance = parseInt((data[index + 0] * 0.3) +\n                                             (data[index + 1] * 0.59) +\n                                             (data[index + 2] * 0.11));\n                            data[index + 0] = data[index + 1] =\n                        data[index + 2] = luminance;\n                }\n\n                Filters.notifyProgress(imageData, x, y, this);\n            }\n\n            Filters.notifyProgress(imageData, w, h, this);\n        }\n    });\n\nOnce the filter has been applied we can have that reflected on the canvas by calling the [*putImageData*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff975423(v=vs.85).aspx) method passing in the modified image data object. While the weighted grayscale filter is fairly simple most of the other filters use an image processing technique known as *convolution*. The code for all the filters is available in *filters.js* and the convolution filters were ported from the C code available [here](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/filtering.html).\n\n### Web Workers\n\nAs you might imagine doing all this number crunching to apply the filters can potentially take a long time to complete. The *motion blur* filter for instance uses a 9x9 filter matrix for computing the new value for every single pixel and is in fact the most CPU intensive filter among them all. If we were to do all this computation on the UI thread of the browser then the app would essentially freeze every time a filter was being applied. To provide a responsive user experience the app delegates the core image processing tasks to a background script using the support for W3C [Web Workers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673568(v=vs.85).aspxhttp:/msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673568(v=vs.85).aspx) in modern browsers.\n\nWeb workers allow web applications to have scripts run in a background task that executes in parallel along with the UI thread. Communication between the worker and the UI thread is accomplished by passing messages using the [*postMessage*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/cc197015.aspx) API. On both ends (i.e. the UI thread and the worker) this manifests as an event notification that you can handle. You can only pass \"data\" between workers and the UI thread, i.e., you cannot pass anything that has to do with the user interface - you cannot for instance, pass DOM elements to the worker from the UI thread.\n\nIn *InstaFuzz* the worker is implemented in the file *filter-worker.js*. All it does in the worker is handle the [*onmessage*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/cc197057.aspx) event and apply a filter and then pass the results back via *postMessage*. As it turns out, even though we cannot pass DOM elements (which means we cannot just hand a CANVAS element to the worker to have the filter applied) we can in fact pass the image data object as returned by the *getImageData* method that we discussed earlier. Here's the filter processing code from *filter-worker.js*:\n\n    importScripts(\"ns.js\", \"filters.js\");\n\n    var tag = null;\n    onmessage = function (e) {\n        var opt = e.data;\n        var imageData = opt.imageData;\n        var filter;\n        \n        tag = opt.tag;\n        filter = InstaFuzz.Filters.getFilter(opt.filterKey);\n\n        var start = Date.now();\n        filter.apply(imageData);\n        var end = Date.now();\n\n        postMessage({\n            type: \"image\",\n            imageData: imageData,\n            filterId: filter.id,\n            tag: tag,\n            timeTaken: end - start\n        });\n    }\n\nThe first line pulls in some script files that the worker depends on by calling [*importScripts*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/hh772875.aspx). This is similar to including a JavaScript file in a HTML document using the SCRIPT tag. Then we set up a handler for the *onmessage* event in response to which we simply apply the filter in question and pass the result back to the UI thread by calling *postMessage*. Simple enough!\n\nThe code that initializes the worker is in *instafuzz.js* and looks like this:\n\n    var worker = new Worker(\"js/filter-worker.js\");\n\nNot much is it? When a message is sent by the worker to the UI thread we handle it by specifying a handler for the *onmessage* event on the worker object. Here's how this is done in *InstaFuzz*:\n\n    worker.onmessage = function (e) {\n        var isPreview = e.data.tag;\n        switch (e.data.type) {\n            case \"image\":\n                if (isPreview) {\n                    previewRenderers[e.data.filterId].\n                        context.putImageData(\n                            e.data.imageData, 0, 0);\n                } else {\n                    mainRenderer.context.putImageData(\n                        e.data.imageData, 0, 0);\n                }\n\n                break;\n            // more code here\n        }\n    };\n\nThe code should be fairly self-explanatory. It simply picks the image data object sent by the worker and applies it to the relevant canvas's context object causing the modified image to be rendered on screen. Scheduling a filter for conversion with the worker is equally simple. Here's the routine that performs this function in *InstaFuzz*:\n\n    function scheduleFilter(filterId,\n                            renderer,\n                            img, isPreview,\n                            resetRender) {\n        if (resetRender) {\n            renderer.clearCanvas();\n            renderer.renderImage(img);\n        }\n\n        var imageData = renderer.context.getImageData(\n            0, 0,\n            renderer.size.width,\n            renderer.size.height);\n\n        worker.postMessage({\n            imageData: imageData,\n            width: imageData.width,\n            height: imageData.height,\n            filterKey: filterId,\n            tag: isPreview\n        });\n    }\n\n### In conclusion\n\nWe saw that fairly intricate user experiences are possible today with HTML5 technologies such as Canvas, Drag/Drop, File API and Web Workers. Support for all of these technologies is quite good in pretty much all modern browsers. One thing that we did not address here is the question of making the app compatible with older browsers. That, truth be told, is a non-trivial but necessary task that I will hopefully be able to talk about in a future article.\n","html":"<p>In <a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/entry-BuildinganInstagramclonePart1.aspx\">part 1</a> we took a look at some of the UI layout implementation details of the <a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/arbit/InstaFuzz/\">InstaFuzz</a> app.  You can get the source code for the app from <a href=\"http://sdrv.ms/14B672O\">here</a> if you wish to run it locally.  In this installment we'll take a look at some of the other bits such as how drag/drop, File API, Canvas and Web Workers are used.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dragdrop\">Drag/Drop</h3>\n\n<p>One of the things that <em>InstaFuzz</em> supports is the ability to drag and drop image files directly on to the big blackish/blue box. Support for this is enabled by handling the \"drop\" event on the CANVAS element. When a file is dropped onto an HTML element the browser fires the \"drop\" event on that element and passes in a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/ms535861.aspx\"><em>dataTransfer</em></a> object which contains a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ie/hh772716.aspx\"><em>files</em></a> property that contains a reference to the list of files that were dropped. Here's how this is handled in the app (\"picture\" is the ID of the CANVAS element on the page):</p>\n\n<pre><code>var pic = $(\"#picture\");\npic.bind(\"drop\", function (e) {\n    suppressEvent(e);\n    var files = e.originalEvent.dataTransfer.files;\n    // more code here to open the file\n});\npic.bind(\"dragover\", suppressEvent).bind(\"dragenter\", suppressEvent);\nfunction suppressEvent(e) {\n    e.stopPropagation();\n    e.preventDefault();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <em>files</em> property is a collection of <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ie/hh772305.aspx\"><em>File</em></a> objects that can then subsequently be used with the File API to access the file contents (covered in the next section). We also handle the <em>dragover</em> and <em>dragenter</em> events and basically prevent those events from propagating to the browser thereby preventing the browser from handling the file drop. IE for instance might unload the current page and attempt to open the file directly otherwise.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fileapi\">File API</h3>\n\n<p>Once the file has been dropped, the app attempts to open the image and render it in the canvas. It does this by using the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673542(v=vs.85).aspx\">File API</a>. The File API is a W3C specification that allows web apps to programmatically access files from the local file system in a secure fashion. In <em>InstaFuzz</em> we use the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772310(v=vs.85).aspx\"><em>FileReader</em></a> object to read the file contents as a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/cc848897.aspx\">data URL</a> string like so using the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772313(v=vs.85).aspx\"><em>readAsDataURL</em></a> method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var reader = new FileReader();\nreader.onloadend = function (e2) {\n    drawImageToCanvas(e2.target.result);\n};\nreader.readAsDataURL(files[0]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, <em>files</em> is the collection of <em>File</em> objects retrieved from the function handling the \"drop\" event on the CANVAS element. Since we are interested only in a single file we simply pick the first file from the collection and ignore the rest if there are any. The actual file contents are loaded asynchronously and once the load completes, the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh772337(v=vs.85).aspx\"><em>onloadend</em></a> event is fired where we get the file contents as a data URL which we then subsequently draw on to the canvas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"renderingthefilters\">Rendering the filters</h3>\n\n<p>Now the core functionality here is of course the application of the filters. In order to be able to apply the filter to the image we need a way to access the individual pixels from the image. And before we can access the pixels we need to have actually rendered the image on to our canvas. So let's first take a look at the code that renders the image that the user picked on to the canvas element.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"renderingimagesontothecanvas\">Rendering images on to the canvas</h4>\n\n<p>The canvas element supports the rendering of <em>Image</em> objects via the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff975414(v=vs.85).aspx\"><em>drawImage</em></a> method. To load up the image file in an <em>Image</em> instance, <em>InstaFuzz</em> uses the following utility routine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>App.Namespace.define(\"InstaFuzz.Utils\", {\n    loadImage: function (url, complete) {\n        var img = new Image();\n        img.src = url;\n        img.onload = function () {\n            complete(img);\n        };\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This allows the app to load up image objects from a URL using code such as the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function drawImageToCanvas(url) {\n    InstaFuzz.Utils.loadImage(url, function (img) {\n        // save reference to source image\n        sourceImage = img;\n\n        mainRenderer.clearCanvas();\n        mainRenderer.renderImage(img);\n\n        // load image filter previews\n        loadPreviews(img);\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, <em>mainRenderer</em> is an instance created from the <em>FilterRenderer</em> constructor function defined in <em>filter-renderer.js</em>. The app uses <em>FilterRenderer</em> objects to manage canvas elements - both in the preview pane as well as the main canvas element on the right. The <em>renderImage</em> method on the <em>FilterRenderer</em> has been defined like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>FilterRenderer.prototype.renderImage = function (img) {\n    var imageWidth = img.width;\n    var imageHeight = img.height;\n    var canvasWidth = this.size.width;\n    var canvasHeight = this.size.height;\n    var width, height;\n\n    if ((imageWidth / imageHeight) &gt;= (canvasWidth / canvasHeight)) {\n        width = canvasWidth;\n        height = (imageHeight * canvasWidth / imageWidth);\n    } else {\n        width = (imageWidth * canvasHeight / imageHeight);\n        height = canvasHeight;\n    }\n\n    var x = (canvasWidth - width) / 2;\n    var y = (canvasHeight - height) / 2;\n    this.context.drawImage(img, x, y, width, height);\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That might seem like a lot of code but all it does ultimately is to figure out the best way to render the image in the available screen area considering the aspect ratio of the image. The key piece of code that actually renders the image on the canvas occurs on the last line of the method. The <em>context</em> member refers to the 2D context acquired from the canvas object by calling its <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff975238(v=vs.85).aspx\"><em>getContext</em></a> method.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"fetchingpixelsfromthecanvas\">Fetching pixels from the canvas</h4>\n\n<p>Now that the image has been rendered we will need access to the individual pixels in order to apply all the different filters that are available. This is easily acquired by calling <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff975418(v=vs.85).aspx\"><em>getImageData</em></a> on the canvas's context object. Here's how <em>InstaFuzz</em> calls this from <em>instafuzz.js</em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var imageData = renderer.context.getImageData(\n    0, 0,\n    renderer.size.width,\n    renderer.size.height);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The object returned by <em>getImageData</em> provides access to the individual pixels via its <em>data</em> property which in turn is an array like object that contains a collection of byte values where each value represents the color rendered for a single channel of a single pixel. Each pixel is represented using 4 bytes that specify values for the red, green, blue and alpha channels. It also has a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff974921(v=vs.85).aspx\"><em>length</em></a> property that returns the length of the buffer. If you have a 2D co-ordinate you can easily transform that into an index into this array using code such as the following. The color intensity values of each channel ranges from 0 through 255. Here's the utility function from <em>filters.js</em> that accepts as input an image data object along with 2D coordinates for the pixel the caller is interested in and returns an object containing the color values:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function getPixel(imageData, x, y) {\n    var data = imageData.data, index = 0;\n\n    // normalize x and y and compute index\n    x = (x &lt; 0) ? (imageData.width + x) : x;\n    y = (y &lt; 0) ? (imageData.height + y) : y;\n    index = (x + y * imageData.width) * 4;\n\n    return {\n        r: data[index],\n        g: data[index + 1],\n        b: data[index + 2]\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"applyingthefilters\">Applying the filters</h4>\n\n<p>Now that we have access to the individual pixels, applying the filter is fairly straightforward. Here, for instance is the function that applies a weighted grayscale filter on the image. It simply picks intensities from the red, green and blue channels and sums them up after applying a multiplication factor on each channel and then assigns the result for all 3 channels.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// \"Weighted Grayscale\" filter\nFilters.addFilter({\n    name: \"Weighted Grayscale\",\n    apply: function (imageData) {\n        var w = imageData.width, h = imageData.height;\n        var data = imageData.data;\n        var index;\n        for (var y = 0; y &lt; h; ++y) {\n            for (var x = 0; x &lt; w; ++x) {\n                index = (x + y * imageData.width) * 4;\n                var luminance = parseInt((data[index + 0] * 0.3) +\n                                         (data[index + 1] * 0.59) +\n                                         (data[index + 2] * 0.11));\n                        data[index + 0] = data[index + 1] =\n                    data[index + 2] = luminance;\n            }\n\n            Filters.notifyProgress(imageData, x, y, this);\n        }\n\n        Filters.notifyProgress(imageData, w, h, this);\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once the filter has been applied we can have that reflected on the canvas by calling the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff975423(v=vs.85).aspx\"><em>putImageData</em></a> method passing in the modified image data object.

The modern desktop on Windows 8 is a classic example. Here's a zoomed out view of my current desktop for instance:\n\n> [![image](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img38.png \"image\")](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img37.png)\n\nYou'll note that the tiles have been grouped into separate sections and each section contains tiles of different sizes. In this case there are only 2 sizes - a wide tile:\n\n> [![image](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img40.png \"image\")](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img39.png)\n\nAnd a square tile:\n\n> [![image](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img42.png \"image\")](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img41.png)\n\nHere's an example of an app that uses different tile sizes in different groups:\n\n> [![image](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img44.png \"image\")](http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img43.png)\n\nI'd been meaning to write down exactly how we can customize the WinJS [**ListView**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211837.aspx) to create interfaces such as this one and, well, here it is. The basic technique for implementing variable tiles with the WinJS **ListView** involves the following things:\n\n1.  Determine what your \"cell unit\" is going to be.  This is the width and height of a single \"unit\" in pixels - the idea is that tile sizes must be a multiple of this.  For example, I might decide that my cell unit is going to be 15x20 pixels.  Then valid tile sizes would be 15x40, 30x20, 45x300 etc.  Once you know what this is, implement the **[groupInfo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211744.aspx)** property on the **[GridLayout](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211751.aspx)** object on your list view's [layout](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211833.aspx) like so.\n\n        ready: function (element, options) {\n            // more stuff here\n            var layout = new WinJS.UI.GridLayout();\n            layout.groupInfo = this.getGroupInfo.bind(this);\n            // more stuff here\n        },\n\n        getGroupInfo: function () {\n            return {\n                enableCellSpanning: true,\n                cellWidth: 15,\n                cellHeight: 20\n            }\n        },\n\n2.  Since different tiles in your control can be of different sizes you'll need to tell the **ListView** what those sizes are going to be.  You do this by implementing a method called **[itemInfo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh758348.aspx)** on your **GridLayout** object.  The **ListView**calls **itemInfo** for every element it renders from the data source.  The important thing to remember is that the size you return from the **itemInfo** method must be a multiple of the size you returned from **groupInfo**.\n\n        ready: function (element, options) {\n            // more stuff here\n            var layout = new WinJS.UI.GridLayout();\n            layout.itemInfo = this.getItemInfo.bind(this);\n            // more stuff here\n        }\n\n        getItemInfo: function (index) {\n            var data = ImageData.imagesList.getAt(index);\n            var size = {\n                width: 150,\n                height: 200,\n                newColumn: false\n            };\n            if (data.group.name === \n                   ImageData.imageGroups.kittens.name) {\n                size.height = 100;\n            }\n            else if (data.group.name ===\n                   ImageData.imageGroups.portraits.name) {\n                size.width = 120;\n            }\n            return size;\n        },\n\n3.  Associate a JS function for your list view's **[itemTemplate](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh700705.aspx)** property.  The job of this function is to render an item.\n\n        listView.itemTemplate = this.selectItemTemplate.bind(this);\n\n    It is passed a [WinJS.Promise](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211867.aspx) object as a parameter which when resolved will yield the data item which is to be rendered.  We can either manually create DOM elements using [document.createElement](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms536389(v=vs.85).aspx) from this routine or, as is more convenient, use declaratively pre-created [WinJS.Binding.Template](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br229723.aspx) instances from the HTML mark-up.  Here's an example implementation showing how to do this:\n\n        selectItemTemplate: function(itemPromise, recycle) {\n            return itemPromise.then(function (item) {\n                var data = item.data;\n                var template;\n                if (data.group.name ===\n                        ImageData.imageGroups.kittens.name) {\n                    template = document.querySelector(\"#wide-template\").\n                        winControl;\n                }\n                else if (data.group.name ===\n                        ImageData.imageGroups.portraits.name) {\n                    template = document.querySelector(\"#long-template\").\n                        winControl;\n                }\n                else {\n                    template = document.\n                        querySelector(\"#default-template\").winControl;\n                }\n                return template.render(item.data);\n            });\n        },\n\nAs you can tell we first wait for the promise to resolve and then take the data and do some custom template selection logic to pick a template from the DOM and then call its **[render](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br229724.aspx)** method passing in the data object as binding context. You will need to ensure that the styling you use on your template mark-up matches up with the size you return from **itemInfo** as otherwise you might end up with blank spaces in your tiles where the styling doesn't get applied (now, you might want to do this deliberately of course, in which case its totally fine). That's pretty much it!","html":"<p>Windows Store apps on Windows 8 often use a grouped tile style for rendering user interfaces. The modern desktop on Windows 8 is a classic example. Here's a zoomed out view of my current desktop for instance:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img37.png\"><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img38.png\" alt=\"image\" title=\"image\" /></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You'll note that the tiles have been grouped into separate sections and each section contains tiles of different sizes. In this case there are only 2 sizes - a wide tile:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img39.png\"><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img40.png\" alt=\"image\" title=\"image\" /></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And a square tile:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img41.png\"><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img42.png\" alt=\"image\" title=\"image\" /></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here's an example of an app that uses different tile sizes in different groups:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img43.png\"><img src=\"http://blogorama.nerdworks.in/images/_img44.png\" alt=\"image\" title=\"image\" /></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'd been meaning to write down exactly how we can customize the WinJS <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211837.aspx\"><strong>ListView</strong></a> to create interfaces such as this one and, well, here it is. The basic technique for implementing variable tiles with the WinJS <strong>ListView</strong> involves the following things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Determine what your \"cell unit\" is going to be.  This is the width and height of a single \"unit\" in pixels - the idea is that tile sizes must be a multiple of this.  For example, I might decide that my cell unit is going to be 15x20 pixels.  Then valid tile sizes would be 15x40, 30x20, 45x300 etc.  Once you know what this is, implement the <strong><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211744.aspx\">groupInfo</a></strong> property on the <strong><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211751.aspx\">GridLayout</a></strong> object on your list view's <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211833.aspx\">layout</a> like so.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ready: function (element, options) {\n    // more stuff here\n    var layout = new WinJS.UI.GridLayout();\n    layout.groupInfo = this.getGroupInfo.bind(this);\n    // more stuff here\n},\n\n\ngetGroupInfo: function () {\n    return {\n        enableCellSpanning: true,\n        cellWidth: 15,\n        cellHeight: 20\n    }\n},\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Since different tiles in your control can be of different sizes you'll need to tell the <strong>ListView</strong> what those sizes are going to be.  You do this by implementing a method called <strong><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh758348.aspx\">itemInfo</a></strong> on your <strong>GridLayout</strong> object.  The <strong>ListView</strong>calls <strong>itemInfo</strong> for every element it renders from the data source.  The important thing to remember is that the size you return from the <strong>itemInfo</strong> method must be a multiple of the size you returned from <strong>groupInfo</strong>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ready: function (element, options) {\n    // more stuff here\n    var layout = new WinJS.UI.GridLayout();\n    layout.itemInfo = this.getItemInfo.bind(this);\n    // more stuff here\n}\n\n\ngetItemInfo: function (index) {\n    var data = ImageData.imagesList.getAt(index);\n    var size = {\n        width: 150,\n        height: 200,\n        newColumn: false\n    };\n    if (data.group.name === \n           ImageData.imageGroups.kittens.name) {\n        size.height = 100;\n    }\n    else if (data.group.name ===\n           ImageData.imageGroups.portraits.name) {\n        size.width = 120;\n    }\n    return size;\n},\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Associate a JS function for your list view's <strong><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh700705.aspx\">itemTemplate</a></strong> property.  The job of this function is to render an item.</p>\n\n<pre><code>listView.itemTemplate = this.selectItemTemplate.bind(this);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is passed a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211867.aspx\">WinJS.Promise</a> object as a parameter which when resolved will yield the data item which is to be rendered.  We can either manually create DOM elements using <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms536389(v=vs.85).aspx\">document.createElement</a> from this routine or, as is more convenient, use declaratively pre-created <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br229723.aspx\">WinJS.Binding.Template</a> instances from the HTML mark-up.  Here's an example implementation showing how to do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>selectItemTemplate: function(itemPromise, recycle) {\n    return itemPromise.then(function (item) {\n        var data = item.data;\n        var template;\n        if (data.group.name ===\n                ImageData.imageGroups.kittens.name) {\n            template = document.querySelector(\"#wide-template\").\n                winControl;\n        }\n        else if (data.group.name ===\n                ImageData.imageGroups.portraits.name) {\n            template = document.querySelector(\"#long-template\").\n                winControl;\n        }\n        else {\n            template = document.\n                querySelector(\"#default-template\").winControl;\n        }\n        return template.render(item.data);\n    });\n},\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As you can tell we first wait for the promise to resolve and then take the data and do some custom template selection logic to pick a template from the DOM and then call its <strong><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br229724.aspx\">render</a></strong> method passing in the data object as binding context.

[Bjarne Stroustrup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) says that C++11, which is the latest ratified revision of the C++ standard, \"[feels like a new language](http://herbsutter.com/elements-of-modern-c-style/)\".  I think lambda functions are a big part of what makes the language feel so very different from C++03.  Lambda functions basically allow you to do things like this:\r\n\r\n    vector<int> nums { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };\r\n    auto evens = count_if(begin(nums), end(nums), [](int num) {\r\n        return (num % 2) == 0;\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThe third parameter passed to the standard [count\\_if](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/464xhzk3(v=vs.120).aspx) function is a predicate that is expected to return **true** if the value passed to it satisfies the condition and **false** otherwise.  In the snippet above we simply count the number of instances of even numbers in the collection.  Search for \"C++ lambdas\" on your favorite search engine and you should get plenty of material out there talking about this feature.  What follows in this post are some notes on certain aspects of C++ lambdas that I happened to notice as I was learning about them listed in no particular order.\r\n\r\n1.  You can pass a lambda object around as you would pretty much anything else. Here's a made up example showing how you can pass a lambda as an argument to another function.\r\n\r\n        #include <iostream>\r\n\r\n        using namespace std;\r\n\r\n        template <typename T>\r\n        void call(T);\r\n\r\n        int main() {\r\n          auto fn = []() { cout<<\"Lambda\"<<endl; };\r\n          call(fn);\r\n          return 0;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        template <typename T>\r\n        void call(T fn) {\r\n          fn();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n2.  You can return lambdas from functions like any another object which makes for some interesting possibilities such as the following:\r\n\r\n        #include <iostream>\r\n        #include <functional>\r\n\r\n        using namespace std;\r\n\r\n        template<typename T>\r\n        function<T()> makeAccumulator(T& val, T by) {\r\n            return [=,&val]() {\r\n                return (val += by);\r\n            };\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        int main() {\r\n            int val = 10;\r\n            auto add5 = makeAccumulator(val, 5);\r\n            cout<<add5()<<endl;\r\n            cout<<add5()<<endl;\r\n            cout<<add5()<<endl;\r\n            cout<<endl;\r\n\r\n            val = 100;\r\n            auto add10 = makeAccumulator(val, 10);\r\n            cout<<add10()<<endl;\r\n            cout<<add10()<<endl;\r\n            cout<<add10()<<endl;\r\n\r\n            return 0;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    Which produces the following output:\r\n\r\n        15\r\n        20\r\n        25\r\n\r\n        110\r\n        120\r\n        130\r\n\r\n    The key thing to remember here is that it is your responsibility to make sure that the values you capture in a lambda remain in memory for the lifetime of the lambda itself. The compiler will not for instance, prevent you from capturing local variables by reference in a lambda and if you continue to access a variable that is no longer available, well, then the behavior is undefined.\r\n\r\n3.  Simply defining a lambda causes all variables captured by value by the lambda to be copy constructed. You don't really have to have any code that invokes the lambda in order for the variables to be copied. This is consistent with the idea that creating a lambda function essentially creates a function object which has as instance members the variables that have been captured in the lambda. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n        #include <iostream>\r\n\r\n        using namespace std;\r\n\r\n        class Foo {\r\n        public:\r\n          Foo() {\r\n            cout<<\"Foo::Foo()\"<<endl;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          Foo(const Foo& f) {\r\n            cout<<\"Foo::Foo(const Foo&)\"<<endl;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          ~Foo() {\r\n            cout<<\"Foo~Foo()\"<<endl;\r\n          }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        int main() {\r\n          Foo f;\r\n          auto fn = [f]() { cout<<\"lambda\"<<endl; };\r\n          cout<<\"Quitting.\"<<endl;\r\n          return 0;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    Here's the output this produces:\r\n\r\n        Foo::Foo()\r\n        Foo::Foo(const Foo&)\r\n        Quitting.\r\n        Foo~Foo()\r\n        Foo~Foo()\r\n\r\n    As you can tell, the copy constructor gets invoked even though the lambda itself never gets invoked.\r\n\r\n4.  As an extension of the previous point, if you capture objects by value in a lambda and then proceed to pass that lambda around to other functions by value, then the variables in the closure will also get copy constructed.\r\n\r\n5.  If you reference capture a const local variable, it becomes a const reference in the lambda.\r\n\r\n        #include <iostream>\r\n\r\n        using namespace std;\r\n\r\n        int main() {\r\n            const int val = 10;\r\n            auto f1 = [&val]() {\r\n                val = 20;  // won't compile\r\n                cout<<\"val = \"<<val<<endl;\r\n            };\r\n            f1();\r\n\r\n            return 0;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n6.  In general, when you wish to declare a variable that can hold a reference to a lambda in contexts where *auto* is not permissible (for e.g. function return types or arguments) use **std::function**. An example:\r\n\r\n        #include <iostream>\r\n        #include <functional>\r\n\r\n        using namespace std;\r\n\r\n        function<bool(int)> makeLEPredicate(int max) {\r\n            return [max](int val) -> bool {\r\n                return val <= max;\r\n            };\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        int main() {\r\n            auto le10 = makeLEPredicate(10);\r\n            cout<<le10(8)<<endl;\r\n\r\n            return 0;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    You could alternatively use function templates to achieve the same thing if the semantics of using templates makes sense to your use case.\r\n\r\nThat's all for now. This list might get expanded as I explore lambdas further. As you might have noticed, the ability to use lambdas really does make a significant difference to productivity without sacrificing performance.\r\n","html":"<p>Lambda functions are a new capability introduced in C++ that offers a terse compact syntax for defining functions at the point of their use.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup\">Bjarne Stroustrup</a> says that C++11, which is the latest ratified revision of the C++ standard, \"<a href=\"http://herbsutter.com/elements-of-modern-c-style/\">feels like a new language</a>\".  I think lambda functions are a big part of what makes the language feel so very different from C++03.  Lambda functions basically allow you to do things like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>vector&lt;int&gt; nums { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };\r\nauto evens = count_if(begin(nums), end(nums), [](int num) {\r\n    return (num % 2) == 0;\r\n});\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The third parameter passed to the standard <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/464xhzk3(v=vs.120).aspx\">count_if</a> function is a predicate that is expected to return <strong>true</strong> if the value passed to it satisfies the condition and <strong>false</strong> otherwise.

They were building the app using the HTML/CSS/JS stack and wanted the ability to play audio streams completely from memory instead of loading it up from a file on the file system or a network stream. They needed this because their service implemented a custom Digital Rights Management (DRM) system where the audio content was encrypted and this needed to be decrypted before playback (duh!). They wanted however, to perform this decryption on the fly during playback instead of creating a decrypted version of the content on the file system. In this post I talk about a little sample I put together for them showing how you can achieve this on Windows 8. If you prefer to directly jump into the code and take a look at things on your own, then here's where its at:\r\n\r\n> [https://github.com/avranju/AudioPlayerWithCustomStream](https://github.com/avranju/AudioPlayerWithCustomStream \"https://github.com/avranju/AudioPlayerWithCustomStream\")\r\n\r\n### Playing media streams from memory\r\n\r\nThe primary requirement proved to be fairly straightforward to accomplish. Turns out, there already exists an [SDK sample](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/MediaStreamSource-media-dfd55dff) showing exactly this. The sample shows how to achieve media playback from memory streams using the [Windows.Media.Core.MediaStreamSource](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.core.mediastreamsource.aspx) object. Briefly, here are the steps:\r\n\r\n1.  First you go fetch some metadata from the media stream. In case of audio content, this turns out to be the sample rate, encoding bit rate, duration and number of channels. For file based audio sources, the [Windows.Storage.StorageFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.storagefile.aspx) object has the ability to extract this information from the file directly via [Windows.Storage.StorageFile.Properties.RetrievePropertiesAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh770652.aspx). Here's an example function that accepts a `StorageFile` object as input and then extracts and returns the said metadata from it.\r\n\r\n        function loadProps(file) {\r\n            var props = {\r\n                fileName: \"\",\r\n                sampleRate: 0,\r\n                bitRate: 0,\r\n                channelCount: 0,\r\n                duration: 0\r\n            };\r\n\r\n            // save file name\r\n            props.fileName = file.name;\r\n            return file.properties.getMusicPropertiesAsync().then(\r\n             function (musicProps) {\r\n                // save duration\r\n                props.duration = musicProps.duration;\r\n\r\n                var encProps = [\r\n                    \"System.Audio.SampleRate\",\r\n                    \"System.Audio.ChannelCount\",\r\n                    \"System.Audio.EncodingBitrate\"\r\n                ];\r\n\r\n                return file.properties.retrievePropertiesAsync(encProps);\r\n            }).then(function (encProps) {\r\n                // save encoding properties\r\n                props.sampleRate = \r\n                   encProps[\"System.Audio.SampleRate\"];\r\n                props.bitRate =\r\n                   encProps[\"System.Audio.EncodingBitrate\"];\r\n                props.channelCount =\r\n                   encProps[\"System.Audio.ChannelCount\"];\r\n\r\n                return props;\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n\r\n2.  Wrap the metadata gathered in step 1 in a [Windows.Media.MediaProperties.AudioEncodingProperties](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.mediaproperties.audioencodingproperties.aspx) object which in turn is then wrapped in a [Windows.Media.Core.AudioStreamDescriptor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.core.audiostreamdescriptor.aspx) object.\r\n3.  Use the `AudioStreamDescriptor` object to initialize a `MediaStreamSource` instance and setup event handlers for the `MediaStreamSource`'s `Starting`, `SampleRequested` and `Closed` events. As you might imagine, the idea is to respond to these events by handing out audio data to the `MediaStreamSource `which then proceeds to play that content.\r\n\r\nThis is all fine and dandy, but how do we get this to work when the audio content is stored in memory in an [Windows.Storage.Streams.InMemoryRandomAccessStream](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.streams.inmemoryrandomaccessstream.aspx) object? The challenge of course is in extracting the metadata we need to setup a `MediaStreamSource` object.\r\n\r\n### StorageFile can read from arbitrary streams?\r\n\r\nAs it happens, the `StorageFile` object has direct support for having it powered by an arbitrary stream (or pretty much anything really). I figured I'll hook up a `StorageFile` with an `InMemoryRandomAccessStream` object and have it extract the metadata that I needed. Here's how you connect a `StorageFile` with data fetched from any arbitrary source - in this case, just a string constant. You create a `StorageFile` object by calling [StorageFile.CreateStreamedFileAsync](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.storagefile.createstreamedfileasync.aspx). `CreateStreamedFileAsync` requires that you pass a reference to a callback routine which is expected to supply the data the `StorageFile` object needs when it is first accessed. Here's a brief example:\r\n\r\n    function init() {\r\n        var reader;\r\n        var size = 0;\r\n\r\n        Windows.Storage.StorageFile.createStreamedFileAsync(\r\n               \"foo.txt\", generateData, null).then(\r\n           function (file) {\r\n            // open a stream on the file and read the data;\r\n            // this will cause the StorageFile object to\r\n            // invoke the \"generateData\" function\r\n            return file.openReadAsync();\r\n        }).then(function (stream) {\r\n            var inputStream = stream.getInputStreamAt(0);\r\n            reader = new Windows.Storage.Streams.DataReader(inputStream);\r\n            size = stream.size;\r\n            return reader.loadAsync(size);\r\n        }).then(function () {\r\n            var str = reader.readString(size);\r\n            console.log(str);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function generateData(stream) {\r\n        var writer = new Windows.Storage.Streams.DataWriter();\r\n        writer.writeString(\"Some arbit random data.\");\r\n\r\n        var buffer = writer.detachBuffer();\r\n        writer.close();\r\n\r\n        stream.writeAsync(buffer).then(function () {\r\n            return stream.flushAsync();\r\n        }).done(function () {\r\n            stream.close();\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe problem however, as I ended up discovering, is that `StorageFile` objects that work off of a stream created in this fashion do not support retrieval of file properties via `StorageFile.Properties.RetrievePropertiesAsync` or for that matter `StorageFile.Properties.GetMusicPropertiesAsync`. So clearly, this approach is not going to work. Having said that its useful to know that this technique is possible at all with `StorageFile` objects as it allows you to defer performing the actual work of producing the data represented by the `StorageFile` object till it is actually needed. And being a bona fide Windows Runtime object you can confidently pass this around wherever a `StorageFile` object is accepted - for instance when implementing a share source contract you might hand out a `StorageFile` object created in this manner via [Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer.DataPackage.SetStorageItems](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.datatransfer.datapackage.setstorageitems.aspx).\r\n\r\n### Reading music metadata using the Microsoft Media Foundation\r\n\r\nAfter a bit of research I discovered that there is another API that can be used for fetching metadata from media streams (among other things) called the [Microsoft Media Foundation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms694197(v=vs.85).aspx). In particular, the API features an object called the [source reader](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374655(v=vs.85).aspx) that can be used to get the data we are after. The trouble though is that this is a COM based API and cannot therefore be directly invoked from JavaScript. I decided to write a little wrapper Windows Runtime component in C++ and then use that from the JS app. After non-trivial help from my colleague [Chris Guzak](https://github.com/ChrisGuzak) and others directly from the Media Foundation team at Microsoft (perks of working for Microsoft I guess!) we managed to put together a small component that allows us to read the required meta data from an `InMemoryRandomAccessStream` object. Here's relevant snippet that does the main job (stripped out all the error handling code to de-clutter the code):\r\n\r\n    MFAttributesHelper(InMemoryRandomAccessStream^ stream, String^ mimeType)\r\n    {\r\n        MFStartup(MF_VERSION);\r\n\r\n        // create an IMFByteStream from \"stream\"\r\n        ComPtr<IMFByteStream> byteStream;\r\n        MFCreateMFByteStreamOnStreamEx(\r\n               reinterpret_cast<IUnknown*>(stream),\r\n               &byteStream);\r\n\r\n        // assign mime type to the attributes on this byte stream\r\n        ComPtr<IMFAttributes> attributes;\r\n        byteStream.As(&attributes);\r\n        attributes->SetString(\r\n               MF_BYTESTREAM_CONTENT_TYPE,\r\n               mimeType->Data());\r\n\r\n        // create a source reader from the byte stream\r\n        ComPtr<IMFSourceReader> sourceReader;\r\n        MFCreateSourceReaderFromByteStream(\r\n               byteStream.Get(),\r\n               nullptr,\r\n               &sourceReader);\r\n\r\n        // get current media type\r\n        ComPtr<IMFMediaType> mediaType;\r\n        sourceReader->GetCurrentMediaType(\r\n               MF_SOURCE_READER_FIRST_AUDIO_STREAM,\r\n               &mediaType);\r\n\r\n        // get all the data we're looking for\r\n        PROPVARIANT prop;\r\n        sourceReader->GetPresentationAttribute(\r\n               MF_SOURCE_READER_MEDIASOURCE,\r\n               MF_PD_DURATION,\r\n               &prop);\r\n        Duration = prop.uhVal.QuadPart;\r\n\r\n        UINT32 data;\r\n        sourceReader->GetPresentationAttribute(\r\n               MF_SOURCE_READER_MEDIASOURCE,\r\n               MF_PD_AUDIO_ENCODING_BITRATE,\r\n               &prop);\r\n        BitRate = prop.ulVal;\r\n\r\n        mediaType->GetUINT32(\r\n               MF_MT_AUDIO_SAMPLES_PER_SECOND,\r\n               &data);\r\n        SampleRate = data;\r\n\r\n        mediaType->GetUINT32(\r\n               MF_MT_AUDIO_NUM_CHANNELS,\r\n               &data);\r\n        ChannelCount = data;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is the implementation of the constructor on the `MFAttributesHelper` ref class. As you can tell, the constructor accepts a reference to an instance of an `InMemoryRandomAccessStream` object and the MIME type of the content in question and proceeds to extract the duration, encoding bitrate, sample rate and channel count from it. It does this by first creating an [IMFByteStream](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms698720(v=vs.85).aspx) object via the convenient [MFCreateMFByteStreamOnStreamEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh162754(v=vs.85).aspx) function which basically wraps an [IRandomAccessStream](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/windows.storage.streams.irandomaccessstream.aspx) object (which `InMemoryRandomAccessStream` implements) and returns an `IMFByteStream` instance. The object returned by `MFCreateMFByteStreamOnStreamEx` also implements [IMFAttributes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms704598(v=vs.85).aspx) which we then [QueryInterface](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682521(v=vs.85).aspx) for (via [ComPtr::As](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/br230426.aspx)) and assign the MIME type value to it. Next we instantiate an object that implements [IMFSourceReader](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374655(v=vs.85).aspx) via [MFCreateSourceReaderFromByteStream](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd388106(v=vs.85).aspx) and use that instance to fetch the duration and encoding bitrate values via the [GetPresentationAttribute](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374662(v=vs.85).aspx) method. And finally, we retrieve an object that implements the [IMFMediaType](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms704850(v=vs.85).aspx) interface via [IMFSourceReader::GetCurrentMediaType](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374660(v=vs.85).aspx) and use that object to fetch the sample rate and the channel count values. Once you know how to do all this, it seems quite trivial of course but getting here, believe me, took some doing!\r\n\r\nNow that we have this component, reading the metadata from JavaScript proves to be fairly straightforward. Here's an example. In the code below, `memoryStream` is an `InMemoryRandomAccessStream` instance and `mimeType` is a string with the MIME type of the content:\r\n\r\n    var helper = MFUtils.MFAttributesHelper.create(memoryStream, mimeType);\r\n\r\n    // now, helper's sampleRate, bitRate, duration and channelCount\r\n    // properties contain the data we are looking for\r\n\r\nNow with the metadata handy, we simply follow the steps as outlined earlier in this post to commence playback. As mentioned before the sample is hosted up on Github here:\r\n\r\n> [https://github.com/avranju/AudioPlayerWithCustomStream](https://github.com/avranju/AudioPlayerWithCustomStream \"https://github.com/avranju/AudioPlayerWithCustomStream\")\r\n\r\nFor the sake of the sample, I took a plain [MP3 file](http://testdriveie9.wise.glbdns.microsoft.com/ietestdrivecontent/Musopen.Com%20Symphony%20No.%205%20in%20C%20Minor,%20Op.%2067%20-%20I.%20Allegro%20con%20brio.mp3) and applied a [XOR cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher) on it and then loaded it up and played back from memory applying another XOR transform on the bits before playback. It all works rather well together and again, hat-tip to [Chris Guzak](https://twitter.com/Guz100) for all his help in whittling down the WinRT component down to its essence and really cleaning up its interface!\r\n","html":"<p>A customer I'd been working with recently came up with a support request for a <a href=\"http://dev.windows.com/\">Windows 8 Store app</a> they'd been working on. They were building the app using the HTML/CSS/JS stack and wanted the ability to play audio streams completely from memory instead of loading it up from a file on the file system or a network stream. They needed this because their service implemented a custom Digital Rights Management (DRM) system where the audio content was encrypted and this needed to be decrypted before playback (duh!). They wanted however, to perform this decryption on the fly during playback instead of creating a decrypted version of the content on the file system. In this post I talk about a little sample I put together for them showing how you can achieve this on Windows 8. If you prefer to directly jump into the code and take a look at things on your own, then here's where its at:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p><a href=\"https://github.com/avranju/AudioPlayerWithCustomStream\" title=\"https://github.com/avranju/AudioPlayerWithCustomStream\">https://github.com/avranju/AudioPlayerWithCustomStream</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"playingmediastreamsfrommemory\">Playing media streams from memory</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary requirement proved to be fairly straightforward to accomplish. Turns out, there already exists an <a href=\"http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/MediaStreamSource-media-dfd55dff\">SDK sample</a> showing exactly this. The sample shows how to achieve media playback from memory streams using the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.core.mediastreamsource.aspx\">Windows.Media.Core.MediaStreamSource</a> object. Briefly, here are the steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><p>First you go fetch some metadata from the media stream. In case of audio content, this turns out to be the sample rate, encoding bit rate, duration and number of channels. For file based audio sources, the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.storagefile.aspx\">Windows.Storage.StorageFile</a> object has the ability to extract this information from the file directly via <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh770652.aspx\">Windows.Storage.StorageFile.Properties.RetrievePropertiesAsync</a>.

As you might imagine, the idea is to respond to these events by handing out audio data to the <code>MediaStreamSource</code>which then proceeds to play that content.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>This is all fine and dandy, but how do we get this to work when the audio content is stored in memory in an <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.streams.inmemoryrandomaccessstream.aspx\">Windows.Storage.Streams.InMemoryRandomAccessStream</a> object? The challenge of course is in extracting the metadata we need to setup a <code>MediaStreamSource</code> object.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"storagefilecanreadfromarbitrarystreams\">StorageFile can read from arbitrary streams?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As it happens, the <code>StorageFile</code> object has direct support for having it powered by an arbitrary stream (or pretty much anything really). I figured I'll hook up a <code>StorageFile</code> with an <code>InMemoryRandomAccessStream</code> object and have it extract the metadata that I needed. Here's how you connect a <code>StorageFile</code> with data fetched from any arbitrary source - in this case, just a string constant. You create a <code>StorageFile</code> object by calling <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.storagefile.createstreamedfileasync.aspx\">StorageFile.CreateStreamedFileAsync</a>. <code>CreateStreamedFileAsync</code> requires that you pass a reference to a callback routine which is expected to supply the data the <code>StorageFile</code> object needs when it is first accessed. Here's a brief example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>function init() {\r\n    var reader;\r\n    var size = 0;\r\n\r\n    Windows.Storage.StorageFile.createStreamedFileAsync(\r\n           \"foo.txt\", generateData, null).then(\r\n       function (file) {\r\n        // open a stream on the file and read the data;\r\n        // this will cause the StorageFile object to\r\n        // invoke the \"generateData\" function\r\n        return file.openReadAsync();\r\n    }).then(function (stream) {\r\n        var inputStream = stream.getInputStreamAt(0);\r\n        reader = new Windows.Storage.Streams.DataReader(inputStream);\r\n        size = stream.size;\r\n        return reader.loadAsync(size);\r\n    }).then(function () {\r\n        var str = reader.readString(size);\r\n        console.log(str);\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction generateData(stream) {\r\n    var writer = new Windows.Storage.Streams.DataWriter();\r\n    writer.writeString(\"Some arbit random data.\");\r\n\r\n    var buffer = writer.detachBuffer();\r\n    writer.close();\r\n\r\n    stream.writeAsync(buffer).then(function () {\r\n        return stream.flushAsync();\r\n    }).done(function () {\r\n        stream.close();\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem however, as I ended up discovering, is that <code>StorageFile</code> objects that work off of a stream created in this fashion do not support retrieval of file properties via <code>StorageFile.Properties.RetrievePropertiesAsync</code> or for that matter <code>StorageFile.Properties.GetMusicPropertiesAsync</code>. So clearly, this approach is not going to work. Having said that its useful to know that this technique is possible at all with <code>StorageFile</code> objects as it allows you to defer performing the actual work of producing the data represented by the <code>StorageFile</code> object till it is actually needed. And being a bona fide Windows Runtime object you can confidently pass this around wherever a <code>StorageFile</code> object is accepted - for instance when implementing a share source contract you might hand out a <code>StorageFile</code> object created in this manner via <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.datatransfer.datapackage.setstorageitems.aspx\">Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer.DataPackage.SetStorageItems</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"readingmusicmetadatausingthemicrosoftmediafoundation\">Reading music metadata using the Microsoft Media Foundation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After a bit of research I discovered that there is another API that can be used for fetching metadata from media streams (among other things) called the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms694197(v=vs.85).aspx\">Microsoft Media Foundation</a>.

I decided to start with the simple case of printing out the members of a tuple to the console via `std::cout.` First, I came up with a compile time recursive definition of a variadic template struct that overloads the function call operator like so. You might wonder why I didn’t stick with a plain variadic template function instead. That will become evident in a moment.\n\n     template<int index, typename... Ts>\n     struct print_tuple {\n         void operator() (tuple<Ts...>& t) {\n             cout << get<index>(t) << \" \";\n             print_tuple<index - 1, Ts...>{}(t);\n         }\n     };\n\nClearly, we’ll need to define a base case to break out of the compile time recursion for the `print_tuple` call in the function call operator overload – which in this case would be when the non-type template parameter `index` is equal to zero. So I went ahead and defined the following partial specialization of `print_tuple` specializing on the value zero for the non-type template parameter `index`.\n\n     template<typename... Ts>\n     struct print_tuple<0, Ts...> {\n         void operator() (tuple<Ts...>& t) {\n             cout << get<0>(t) << \" \";\n         }\n     };\n\nThe reason I had to use a variadic template struct instead of a regular variadic template function is that it is [not possible to partially specialize a template function in C++](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill17.htm). Using a struct/class allows us to do so. Now that we have this setup, we can write a utility `print` routine to wrap calls to `print_tuple` and we should be done. Here’s a complete example:\n\n     #include <iostream>\n     #include <tuple>\n\n     using namespace std;\n\n     template<int index, typename... Ts>\n     struct print_tuple {\n         void operator() (tuple<Ts...>& t) {\n             cout << get<index>(t) << \" \";\n             print_tuple<index - 1, Ts...>{}(t);\n         }\n     };\n\n     template<typename... Ts>\n     struct print_tuple<0, Ts...> {\n         void operator() (tuple<Ts...>& t) {\n             cout << get<0>(t) << \" \";\n         }\n     };\n\n     template<typename... Ts>\n     void print(tuple<Ts...>& t) {\n         const auto size = tuple_size<tuple<Ts...>>::value;\n         print_tuple<size - 1, Ts...>{}(t);\n     }\n\n     int main() {\n         auto t = make_tuple(1, 2, \"abc\", \"def\", 4.0f);\n         print(t);\n\n         return 0;\n     }\n\nAll that `print` does is to first determine the size of the tuple via [`tuple_size`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb982495.aspx) and then instantiates `print_tuple` and invokes the function call operator passing the tuple object in question. As you might have noticed we are essentially working our way backwards till we hit the base case where `index` is zero – i.e. it’ll print the tuple members in the reverse order. Here’s the output this produces:\n\n     4 def abc 2 1\n\n### Iterate in order?\n\nI figured, implementing a version that iterates over the tuple members in the order that they are specified should be fairly straightforward. We should just need to define a different base case (for the last item in the tuple instead of the first) and the recursive implementation should simply increment the index instead of decrementing it. Here’s what I came up with:\n\n     template<int index, typename... Ts>\n     struct print_tuple {\n         void operator() (tuple<Ts...>& t) {\n             cout << get<index>(t) << \" \";\n             print_tuple<index + 1, Ts...>{}(t);\n         }\n     };\n\n     template<typename... Ts>\n     struct print_tuple<tuple_size<tuple<Ts...>>::value - 1, Ts...> {\n         void operator() (tuple<Ts...>& t) {\n             cout << get<tuple_size<tuple<Ts...>>::value - 1>(t) << \" \";\n         }\n     };\n\nThe code shown in bold above are the changes of interest. In particular, turns out, the base case definition which handles the situation when `print_tuple` is being instantiated with an `index` that is equal to the size of the tuple minus one, is not really valid C++. Non-type template specialization in C++ can only be done using “simple identifiers”. The expression `tuple_size<tuple<Ts...>>::value - 1` is a compile time constant for sure and ideally the compiler *should* be able to compute that value (which in fact it does for the code in the body of that method definition) but, well, it doesn’t! So, we’re kind of out of luck there.\n\n### Generalized iteration?\n\nOne might imagine that it should be possible to generalize this iteration (even if it can be done in reverse order only) so that we are able to supply arbitrary callbacks for processing tuple members. Turns out this again, is not possible which I think is reasonable. Because at that point one really needs to question whether using a tuple is the correct choice – a `std::vector` or `std::list` or some of the other containers maybe a more appropriate option. Having said that, you might be thinking that we should still be able to generalize this by adding another template parameter for a callback routine and passing in a template function for that parameter. Maybe something like this?\n\n     #include <iostream>\n     #include <tuple>\n\n     using namespace std;\n\n     template<int index, typename TCallback, typename... Ts>\n     struct iterate_tuple {\n         void operator() (tuple<Ts...>& t, TCallback callback) {\n             callback(get<index>(t));\n             iterate_tuple<index - 1, TCallback, Ts...>{}(t, callback);\n         }\n     };\n\n     template<typename TCallback, typename... Ts>\n     struct iterate_tuple<0, TCallback, Ts...> {\n         void operator() (tuple<Ts...>& t, TCallback callback) {\n             callback(get<0>(t));\n         }\n     };\n\n     template<typename TCallback, typename... Ts>\n     void for_each(tuple<Ts...>& t, TCallback callback) {\n         iterate_tuple<tuple_size<tuple<Ts...>>::value - 1, TCallback, Ts...> it;\n         it(t, callback);\n     }\n\n     template<typename T>\n     void print(T v) {\n         cout << v << \" \";\n     }\n\n     int main() {\n         auto t = make_tuple(1, 2, \"abc\", \"def\", 4.0f);\n         for_each(t, print);\n\n         return 0;\n     }\n\nThis won’t work because the compiler needs to know the type of `TCallback` when it is instantiating the `for_each` template function which in this case it doesn’t and neither do we know the type because we want a different version of print to be used for each unique type in the tuple. If there is some way of telling the compiler to postpone resolution of `TCallback` till it is actually used then this might have worked. As far as I know, that isn’t possible. But then I might be wrong. If you know a way of doing that, it’ll be great if you could please let me know in the comments.\n","html":"<p>I’ve been trying to wrap my brain around the new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_Templates\">variadic templates</a> capability in C++11 lately and wondered if it would be possible to write a generic routine to iterate over the members of a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb982837.aspx\"><code>std::tuple</code></a>. I decided to start with the simple case of printing out the members of a tuple to the console via <code>std::cout.</code> First, I came up with a compile time recursive definition of a variadic template struct that overloads the function call operator like so. You might wonder why I didn’t stick with a plain variadic template function instead. That will become evident in a moment.</p>\n\n<pre><code> template&lt;int index, typename... Ts&gt;\n struct print_tuple {\n     void operator() (tuple&lt;Ts...&gt;&amp; t) {\n         cout &lt;&lt; get&lt;index&gt;(t) &lt;&lt; \" \";\n         print_tuple&lt;index - 1, Ts...&gt;{}(t);\n     }\n };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Clearly, we’ll need to define a base case to break out of the compile time recursion for the <code>print_tuple</code> call in the function call operator overload – which in this case would be when the non-type template parameter <code>index</code> is equal to zero. So I went ahead and defined the following partial specialization of <code>print_tuple</code> specializing on the value zero for the non-type template parameter <code>index</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code> template&lt;typename...
